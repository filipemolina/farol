# AGENTS.md

Operating instructions for AI coding agents working on this repository. If
you are a human, read `CONTRIBUTING.md` instead.

This project expects a lot of its contributors to be unsupervised coding
agents working from these documents alone, without the back-and-forth a human
maintainer would normally provide in a PR review. That shapes this file: it is
stricter and more explicit than a typical `CONTRIBUTING.md`, on purpose. If
something here feels over-specified, it is because the alternative was tried
in spirit on a sister project this architecture was copied from, and
under-specification is what produced the need for a document like
`docs/DESIGN.md` in the first place.

## Read this before writing any code

In this order:

1. [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md): the data model, the status/progress
   state machine, the level rules for adding a task, the focus and
   keybinding contract, theming, storage, and the full CLI spec. This is not
   background reading; it is the specification. If your change contradicts
   something in here, either the change is wrong or the document needs to be
   updated *first*, as its own commit, with the reasoning for the change
   written into it.
2. [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md): what has shipped and what it found,
   what is still ahead, and the decisions already taken that a change should
   not re-litigate.
3. **For UI components:** [`docs/UI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](docs/UI_INSTRUCTIONS.md):
   the hardened checklist for visual coherence. Before marking a component
   complete, run through the six rules and the verification script
   (`scripts/verify-ui-component.sh <component-path>`). This is not optional
   polish; it is the mechanical check that keeps all components looking like
   one app rather than a collection of bespoke pieces.

This repository is self-contained: everything a contributor needs is in the
three documents above plus this file. Farol shares its architecture
with one sister project (theming, the single-keymap-package discipline,
request/response commands, panel layout broadcast), but the reasoning behind
every one of those patterns is written into this repo's own docs. You should
never need to leave the repository to find out *why* something is the way it
is. If you find a spot where these docs are silent on a structural question
and you would have to guess or look elsewhere, that is a blank to fill in:
add the answer to the right document in the same commit as the code that
needed it (the same discipline the keybinding and visual-detail rules below
require).

## Rules for not deviating or hallucinating

These are the specific failure modes this file exists to prevent, stated as
rules rather than left implicit:

- **Do not invent a keybinding.** Every key lives in `src/keys`, exactly
  once: components match against those bindings, and the footer and the help
  overlay render from them, so a key declared anywhere else is a key the help
  overlay can't advertise and the next contributor can't discover. If a
  feature needs a key that isn't in
  `docs/DESIGN.md`'s keybinding sections, add it to `src/keys` and to
  `docs/DESIGN.md` in the same commit, not only to the component that
  happens to handle it. A key that works but isn't declared there is a key
  the help overlay can't advertise and the next contributor can't discover.
- **Do not invent a visual detail.** A glyph, an indent width, a padding
  value, which text tier a label uses, how an empty state looks, all of it
  is fixed in `docs/DESIGN.md` §12, not left to the component writing it. If
  something is not covered there, add it to §12 in the same commit, following
  the same discipline the keybinding rule above requires. Run the §12
  "chrome-package
  contract" checklist against any new component before calling it done. A
  component that builds its own padding or picks its own color instead of
  going through `chrome` is the single most common way two phases built
  months apart stop looking like one app.
- **Do not add a dependency not named in `docs/DESIGN.md`.**
  The stack is Bubble Tea v2 / Lip Gloss v2 / Bubbles v2, Cobra,
  `modernc.org/sqlite`, `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` (the config file),
  `github.com/sahilm/fuzzy` (the `/` filter and the Search page), and
  `github.com/charmbracelet/x/ansi` (ANSI-aware width measurement and
  truncation). If a task seems to need something else (a different
  fuzzy-match package, a TUI table widget), that is a signal to re-read
  `docs/DESIGN.md` for whether the existing stack already covers it before
  reaching for something new.
- **Do not implement the status/progress state machine from memory of a
  similar app.** `docs/DESIGN.md` §3 is specific about the auto-completion
  asymmetry (subtask-derived 100% auto-completes; user-set percentage 100%
  does not) precisely because the intuitive, symmetric version is wrong for
  this app. If your change touches `status`, `progress_kind`, or
  `progress_pct`, re-read that section immediately before writing the code,
  every time, not only the first time.
- **Do not let the CLI and the TUI diverge on a write path.** Every mutation
  goes through `src/store`; neither `src/cli` nor `src/model` should contain
  logic that decides *whether* a transition is allowed, only logic that
  calls the `store` function and reports the result. If you find yourself
  writing an `if` that checks `progress_kind` outside `src/store`, stop and
  move it into `store`.
- **Do not guess at a `--json` shape.** `docs/DESIGN.md` §9 states the
  contract: exactly one JSON value on stdout, success or failure, nothing
  else on stdout in that mode. If a subcommand's exact JSON field names
  aren't pinned down yet in that section, propose the shape as part of the
  same commit that implements it, and update `docs/DESIGN.md` to match.
  Don't ship an undocumented shape and leave a future caller to reverse-
  engineer it from the source.
- **Do not resolve an ambiguous id by guessing.** `store.ResolveID` returns
  an error on an ambiguous prefix match; no caller should catch that error
  and silently pick the first result.
- **When anything disagrees with `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md` wins:**
  an issue, a review comment, a task description, your own working notes.
  Those are all narrower than the contract and routinely out of date against
  it. The reverse should never happen silently: if the work reveals that
  `docs/DESIGN.md` itself is wrong or underspecified, fix `docs/DESIGN.md`
  and explain why in the commit message, rather than quietly implementing
  something else and letting the two drift.

## Known hallucination traps in this stack

These are not style preferences. They are places where a plausible,
confident, wrong answer is *more* likely than a correct one, because the
correct answer contradicts what dominates public training data. Each one
below has been verified directly against the installed module source, not
recalled from memory, specifically so this list can be trusted more than the
instinct it is warning you about.

### Bubble Tea v2 / Bubbles v2 / Lip Gloss v2 are not the library you remember

`charm.land/bubbletea/v2`, `charm.land/bubbles/v2`, and `charm.land/lipgloss/v2`
are a breaking rewrite of the `github.com/charmbracelet/{bubbletea,bubbles,lipgloss}`
v1 APIs that make up the overwhelming majority of public Bubble Tea code:
tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and almost certainly most of whatever
pattern your training data associates with "Bubble Tea." A symbol that *feels*
right from memory is more likely a v1 symbol that does not exist in v2 than a
correct guess.

**Before writing the first line of code that touches any of these three
packages, read that package's own upgrade guide.** Each project ships one,
written by its maintainers explicitly for this situation: the file opens
with "written for both humans and LLM-assisted migration tools." Once
`go mod download` (or a `go build`) has fetched the dependency, it's sitting
in your module cache:

```
$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/charm.land/bubbletea/v2@<version>/UPGRADE_GUIDE_V2.md
$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/charm.land/bubbles/v2@<version>/UPGRADE_GUIDE_V2.md
$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/charm.land/lipgloss/v2@<version>/UPGRADE_GUIDE_V2.md
```

(`ls $(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/charm.land/bubbletea/v2*` to find the exact
version directory; it changes as the dependency is updated.) Read the whole
guide for whichever package you're about to use, not the excerpt below;
the excerpt only covers what's highest-impact and easiest to get wrong
silently, not everything that changed.

**Verified, highest-impact differences** (confirmed against the v2.0.x source
in this project's module cache; re-verify against `go doc` if the pinned
version has moved on):

- **`tea.Model.View()` returns a `tea.View` struct, not a `string`.** The
  struct's `Content` field is what used to be the return value; construct one
  with `tea.NewView(s)` or `tea.View{Content: s}`. Writing `func (m Model)
  View() string` will not even satisfy the `tea.Model` interface. You will
  get a compile error, which is one of the better outcomes on this list, but
  only if you don't first "fix" it by trying to make `View()` return a string
  through some wrapper.
- **`tea.KeyMsg` was renamed `tea.KeyPressMsg`.** Every `case tea.KeyMsg:` in
  a remembered v1 example needs to become `case tea.KeyPressMsg:`.
- **`key.Matches` is generic** (`func Matches[Key fmt.Stringer](k Key, b
  ...Binding) bool`), but you call it exactly as before:
  `key.Matches(msg, someBinding)`. If a call site doesn't compile, the type
  being matched needs a `String() string` method, not a different call
  shape.
- **`lipgloss.Color(s string)` returns `image/color.Color`, not a
  string-backed `lipgloss.Color` type.** This is exactly why
  `docs/DESIGN.md` §11's `Theme` struct types every color field as
  `color.Color`. Matching that, not "simplifying" it back to `string`, is
  the point.
- **Exported `Width`/`Height` fields became getter/setter method pairs**
  across `textinput`, `textarea`, `list`, `viewport`, `progress`, and
  `table`: `m.SetWidth(40)` / `m.Width()`, not `m.Width = 40`.
- **`DefaultStyles()` (and similar) now take an explicit `isDark bool`.**
  Lip Gloss v2 removed automatic terminal-background adaptation
  (`AdaptiveColor` is gone); nothing auto-detects light vs. dark anymore.
  This project's theme system (`docs/DESIGN.md` §11) supplies its own colors
  regardless, so this mostly matters for any stock Bubbles component styling
  you leave at its default.
- **`DefaultKeyMap` moved from a package-level `var` to a `func
  DefaultKeyMap() KeyMap`** in `textinput`, `textarea`, and `paginator`:
  call it, don't reference it as a value.
- **`NewModel(...)` constructors are gone; use `New(...)`** everywhere they
  existed in v1 (`help`, `list`, `paginator`, `spinner`, `textinput`).

If a call site referencing one of these packages doesn't compile, the fix is
almost always in the upgrade guide's tables, not in reverting to the v1
import path. The v1 path isn't in `go.mod` and reaching for it is a sign to
stop and read the guide, not to add the dependency.

### modernc.org/sqlite (the `store` package's driver)

- **The registered `database/sql` driver name is `"sqlite"`, not
  `"sqlite3"`.** `sql.Open("sqlite3", …)` is the name the *different*,
  CGO-based `mattn/go-sqlite3` driver registers, and it is what nearly every
  public Go+SQLite example uses, which is exactly why this is easy to get
  wrong on autopilot. This project's `go.mod` does not depend on
  `mattn/go-sqlite3` at all; `sql.Open("sqlite3", …)` will fail at runtime
  with "unknown driver," not at compile time, so it's a mistake that survives
  `go build` and `go vet` and shows up only when `store.Open` is actually
  called.
- **Prefer DSN query parameters over separate `PRAGMA` statements** for
  connection-level settings this driver parses directly off the connection
  string (`?_journal_mode=WAL&_foreign_keys=1&_busy_timeout=5000`) rather
  than a `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` exec after opening. Verified against the
  driver's own DSN parsing in `conn.go`/`driver.go`; if a parameter's exact
  spelling matters and doesn't match what's in the vendored source under
  `$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/modernc.org/sqlite@<version>/`, trust the source
  over this file: driver versions move.
- **`modernc.org/sqlite` pins an exact `modernc.org/libc` version**, and the
  two are not independently upgradable: the transpiled SQLite C code in
  `modernc.org/sqlite` is generated against that specific `libc`. **Never run
  a broad `go get -u ./...` or `go get -u all`** once this dependency is in
  `go.mod`; bump `modernc.org/sqlite` by name and let `go mod tidy` resolve
  `libc` from *its* `go.mod`, never the reverse. This package ships its own
  `CLAUDE.md` at its module root (`$(go env GOPATH)/pkg/mod/modernc.org/sqlite@<version>/CLAUDE.md`)
  with more implementation detail than belongs here. Read it before
  touching anything in `store` that isn't a plain query, e.g. connection
  hooks, custom functions, or vtabs (none of which the current plan needs,
  but a future contributor tempted to add one should read that file first).

### Cobra

Lower risk: the API most training data agrees on here is also the current
one. The one place worth double-checking is the flag-grouping helpers this
project's CLI spec relies on (`MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive` and
`MarkFlagsRequiredTogether`). Both take a variadic list of flag *names*
(strings), not a single name or the flag objects themselves. Run `go doc
github.com/spf13/cobra.Command.MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive` if a call site
doesn't compile, rather than guessing at the signature a second time from
memory.

## How to verify instead of guessing

General habits, not specific to this stack, that catch a wrong assumption
before it becomes ten more lines built on top of it:

- **Before calling a dependency function you didn't write this session,
  confirm its signature with `go doc <package>.<Symbol>`.** It reads the
  actual installed version, not whatever a training corpus happened to
  describe, and it's faster than writing code and finding out from a compile
  error.
- **Before assuming a helper doesn't exist in this repo and writing your own,
  `grep -rn` for it first.** `docs/DESIGN.md` repeatedly names behavior that
  one shared function already provides for every surface (the tree flattening
  in `src/apptypes/flatten.go` that the CLI and the task tree both render
  from, the three `store` mutators in `docs/DESIGN.md` §3), and it describes
  them by what they do, not by the name they ended up with. A second
  implementation of one of these is the most common way the surfaces drift
  apart.
- **Work in the smallest increment you can verify, and verify it before
  writing the next one.** Write one function (or one tight group of related
  ones), then run `go build ./... && go vet ./...` immediately, and `go test
  ./...` too, if it has a test yet. A model's error rate per line written is
  roughly constant regardless of how careful the instructions are; the thing
  that actually works is shrinking how many unverified lines can pile up
  before the first check catches a mistake, not writing any single line more
  carefully.
- **For a function whose correctness is a matter of exact rules rather than
  judgment** (`docs/DESIGN.md` §3's state machine, §4's level-offset table),
  **write the test from the rule's own worked examples before or alongside
  the implementation.** Those sections state their rules as tables, which
  transcribe directly into a table-driven test; treat a passing suite as the
  definition of "implemented," not a read-through of the code that looks
  right.
- **When `docs/DESIGN.md` and the repository disagree, the code is the bug.**
  DESIGN is the contract, not a description of what happens to be there. If
  it names a field, a surface or a rule the code does not have, the fix is to
  make the code match, not to quietly narrow the contract. If DESIGN is
  wrong, change it in the same commit, with the reasoning written in; don't
  invent an undocumented workaround the next reader has no way to discover.
- **Prefer a pure function with a table-driven test over a stateful method
  with none, whenever they're equivalent.** A table of (input → expected
  output) can be checked mechanically, row by row; a stateful `Update`
  handler's correctness has to be reasoned about from a diff.
  `computeTaskRowCols` in `src/components/tasktree/View.go` is the template:
  the whole column drop order is a pure function over widths, and
  `TestComputeTaskRowColsDropOrder` checks it row by row. Follow that shape
  for other small, rule-heavy pieces of logic as they come up (row-flattening's
  depth/collapse bookkeeping is another candidate).

## The loop

Run before every commit:

```bash
make dev            # go run main.go (launches the TUI against your real store;
                    # for throwaway data, point XDG_DATA_HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME
                    # at a temp dir the way demo/seed.sh does)
go build ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./...
gofmt -l .          # must print nothing
```

CI runs exactly these on every pull request, `go test -race` included:
`src/store` opens real SQLite connections and the TUI's poll loop runs on its
own goroutine, both worth checking under the race detector. Keep every commit
green, not just the branch tip.

## Testing

`src/store` is plain Go: no terminal, no Bubble Tea, a real SQLite file in a
temp directory per test. This is where the state-machine rules from
`docs/DESIGN.md` §3 get their tests, and there is no excuse for a change to
that section landing without one: create the scenario (a task in `subtasks`
mode, complete every child, assert the parent auto-completed; a task in
`percentage` mode at 100, assert it did *not* auto-complete), assert the
result.

Above `store`, test in three tiers: components take a message and
hand back a model (assert on the result directly); rendering is a string
(`ansi.Strip(m.View().Content)`, worth asserting on for layout); an
end-to-end rig is the only way to test a full keystroke-to-render flow and
should stay rare, because it's timing-based.

## Style

- **Comments say why, not what.** The code already says what happens; a
  comment earns its place by recording a decision, a constraint, or a trap,
  the kind of thing a future edit would otherwise "fix" back into a bug.
  `docs/DESIGN.md` is where a *design* decision's reasoning belongs, at
  length; a code comment is for the reasoning that's only legible standing
  next to the specific line it explains.
- **Constructors are always `New`; the exported type is always `Model`** for
  a Bubble Tea component, so callers read as `listnamemodal.New(...)` and assert
  on `listnamemodal.Model`.
- Commit messages: a short summary line, then prose explaining why, not what.
  Match the register of the existing `git log` if you want a model to follow.

## Working the task list

Drive the app through its CLI: read the inbox with `farol inbox` at the start
of every session — your list, every foreign list, and their top 20 pending
tasks with notes inlined. Keep their status current as you work, on your own,
without being asked: assign what you take, set progress when you start, and
complete it when done. The human watches the TUI; the statuses are the report.

Follow the progress discipline in `farol skill`: a trivial task takes `simple`
progress and is done; a multi-step task gets a `farol comment` at each
milestone (a comment is a write-heartbeat, so the TUI spinner stays lit and
the task never looks abandoned); on a list you own you may decompose into
subtasks and use `subtasks` mode so the percentage derives from completed
children. Never set a `percentage` you will not maintain — a stale number is
worse than none. Plan your checkpoints when you plan the implementation.

The agent interaction protocol — set `FAROL_AGENT` to a unique tag, grab the
top task with `farol next <list-id>`, update with `farol progress <id> --mode
<mode>`, release with `farol unassign <id>`, and read live claims with `farol
work` — is in [`docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md), and
`farol agent help` prints it from the CLI. `farol skill` is the full command
reference.

## Reference material

The Glossary (the fixed vocabulary: Task, Subtask, Level offset, Tier,
Cascade, Zone, and the words that are *not* synonyms for them) and the
repository layout live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Use the Glossary's terms
everywhere; a term that drifts between "task" and "item" and "todo" across
files is indistinguishable, to the next reader, from three different things.
