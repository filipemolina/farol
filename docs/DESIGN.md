# Design

The guiding decisions of Farol, written down so a contributor —
human or agent — has a north star instead of a one-line feature description to
extrapolate from. Where a rule below looks oddly specific, it is specific on
purpose: it was written to close off a plausible wrong implementation, not to
describe the obvious one.

This document is self-contained: every rule below carries its own reasoning,
and nothing here sends you to another repository's documentation to find out
*why*. Farol shares its architecture with one sister project (they
were built by the same author, one after the other), and several patterns
were ported from it; where that provenance matters, the relevant reasoning is
written out in full in this file instead of being left as a pointer.

## 1. What this app is, and isn't

Farol is a to-do list manager with one store and two ways to reach it: a
terminal UI for the human at the keyboard, and a CLI that is the single
agent-facing front end (scripts and coding agents, including agents that use
Farol as their todo store). Neither is secondary — they simply serve different
users. The TUI does not shell out to the CLI, and the CLI is not a read-only
reporting layer bolted onto a TUI-owned database — both talk to the same
`store` package (§8), and a write from either is visible to the other within
one poll tick (§7).

It is **not**:

- A sync client. No CalDAV, no Todoist, no Nextcloud Tasks. One local SQLite
  file is the entire backend, and farol will stay single-backend: if sharing
  ever matters, it is a sync of that file (or an export from it), never a
  second source of truth. Due dates, CalDAV, and project-management expansion
  (a "Lists → Projects" rename, Gantt views) are deliberately out of scope
  here — they belong to a separate, more dedicated project-management app.
- A project-management tool. There IS an **assignee** and a **priority**
  field (§2, §3) — but as *coordination* primitives for multiple agents,
  not project-management creep: assignment answers "which agent owns this
  task right now", and priority answers "which task should an agent pick
  next". There is still no due date and no Gantt view, and neither is
  planned. §8 explains why the schema is shaped to add columns without a
  migration disaster, the way migration 0006 does for these two.
- A Taskwarrior replacement. Taskwarrior's dependency graph and reporting DSL
  solve a different, harder problem for a different, more demanding user.
  This app's tree is a strict parent/child hierarchy, not an arbitrary DAG —
  see §3.

## 2. Data model

Two entities, `List` and `Task`. A `Task` belongs to exactly one `List` and
has at most one parent `Task`.

```
List
  id            text primary key   -- ULID, generated at insert
  name          text not null
  created_at    integer not null   -- unix seconds
  position      integer not null   -- manual ordering among lists
  created_by    text not null default ''
                -- declared owner tag ("pi", "claude", …); empty = owned by
                -- nobody. The CLI and TUI write '' and ignore it; the agent
                -- front end reads it (§9) to decide list ownership.
  archived_at   integer          -- unix seconds; null = active (the default
                -- for every list). A nullable timestamp rather than a bool
                -- so the archive page can sort by archive date for free.
                -- Migration: 0009

Task
  id             text primary key   -- ULID
  list_id        text not null references List(id)
  parent_id      text references Task(id)   -- null = root-level task
  title          text not null
  notes          text not null default ''
  status         text not null   -- 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'complete'
  progress_kind  text not null default 'none'
                 -- 'none' | 'simple' | 'subtasks' | 'percentage'
  progress_pct   integer          -- 0-100, set only when progress_kind='percentage'
  position       integer not null   -- manual ordering among siblings
  created_at     integer not null
  updated_at     integer not null
  completed_at   integer          -- null unless status='complete'
  assignee       text not null default ''
                 -- agent tag ("pi", "claude", …) holding this task;
                 -- '' = no assignment. NOT presence: AgentActivity (0002)
                 -- is a 120-second heartbeat; this column has no TTL and
                 -- changes on explicit assign/unassign/complete, or when
                 -- the holding agent session ends (§3).
  assigned_at    integer          -- unix seconds; null unless assignee != ''
  priority       text not null default 'none'
                 -- 'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'. Stored, displayed,
                 -- and used by next_task's ordering (§9) — and by nothing
                 -- else: priority does NOT re-sort the tree, which stays
                 -- ordered by `position` alone.
                 -- Migration: 0006
```

Why ULIDs and not autoincrement integers: task and list ids are handed to the
CLI as arguments (`farol <task-id>`) and printed by `add`. A ULID
is a stable, copy-pasteable, sortable-by-creation-time string that never
collides across a `list add` and a concurrent `task add` from two processes —
an autoincrement id needs the database to hand it out, which is fine, but a
ULID lets `store.NewTaskID()` be generated before the transaction opens,
which matters for §7's transaction-shape rule. Ids are **not** meant to be
typed from memory; the CLI accepts an unambiguous *prefix* of an id
(§9, `resolveID`) so a human or an agent copying an 8-character prefix from
`farol tasks` output doesn't have to paste the full 26 characters.

Nesting depth is **not** capped in the schema. `parent_id` is self-referential
and a task can have a task at any depth as its parent. What *is* constrained
is how deep a single **add** operation can reach relative to the currently
selected task (§4) — that is a UI/workflow rule, not a data-model limit nudge
your way to depth 4 across several add operations, and the schema does not
notice or care.

## 3. The status and progress state machine

This is the section most likely to be implemented from intuition rather than
from what's written here. Intuition gets some of it right and a few of the
edges wrong, so read the whole thing before writing `store` code that touches
`status` or `progress_kind`.

**States.** A task's `status` is one of `pending`, `in_progress`, `complete`.
`progress_kind` is `none` for `complete` tasks. For `pending` and `in_progress`
tasks it records the progress tracking mode: `none` (no progress tracking),
`simple` (work started, no percentage), `subtasks` (percentage derived from
direct children), or `percentage` (user-set percentage). A `pending` task
**may** have `progress_kind = 'subtasks'` when it has children but work has not
yet begun on any of them — creating subtasks is planning, not starting. The
invariant that `progress_kind` only *drives behavior* (percentage display,
auto-completion) while `status = in_progress` still holds; for a `pending`
task it records *intent*.

**The three flavors of `in_progress`:**

- `simple` — no number. The task is being worked on; that's the whole claim.
- `percentage` — a user- or agent-set integer 0–100 (`progress_pct`). An
  honest estimate, not a fact the store can verify.
- `subtasks` — `progress_pct` is **not stored**; it is computed on read as
  `round(100 * complete_children / total_children)` over the task's *direct*
  children only (not the whole subtree — a child's own `subtasks`-derived
  percentage already folds its grandchildren in, so re-descending would
  double-count depth). This is a fact the store can verify, which is why it
  behaves differently from `percentage` below.

**Switching a task to `subtasks` mode with zero children is not an error.**
It's a legitimate state: someone is about to add subtasks and set the mode
first. With no children to derive from, the task **displays and behaves as
`simple`** — no percentage shown, no auto-completion — until it has at least
one child. The stored `progress_kind` stays `subtasks` regardless; only the
*display and completion behavior* falls back. The moment a first child
exists, derivation resumes. Do not special-case "zero children" by silently
rewriting `progress_kind` to `simple` — that would lose the user's stated
intent the next time they check the details screen.

**A task that gains its first subtask is auto-switched to `subtasks` mode.**
When any add path (CLI `add --parent`, the TUI's inline create) inserts a
task under a parent whose `progress_kind` is still `none` — the create-time
default, which is the absence of a choice rather than a choice — the store
switches the parent to `subtasks` mode. This sets only the *kind*; it does
**not** start the parent. Creating a subtask is planning, not starting, so a
pending parent stays `pending` until one of its children actually starts. An
explicit kind (`simple`, `subtasks`, `percentage`) is never overridden by this
rule. If the parent is complete, it is reopened to `pending` (lossy, per §3)
before the auto-switch applies, because a complete task with a pending child
is a forbidden state. Both add paths share the switch, so the CLI and the TUI
cannot diverge on whether a new subtask starts its parent.

**A subtasks-mode parent's status is derived from its direct children.** A
parent whose `progress_kind = 'subtasks'` is `in_progress` when any direct
child is `in_progress` or `complete`, and `pending` when every direct child is
`pending` again. This is the two-way counterpart to auto-completion below: it
keeps a parent's "started" state honest against its children, so a parent does
not sit `in_progress` forever after one child started and the rest were
reopened. The store recomputes it on every child status write (completing a
child starts its parent; reopening the last in-progress child returns the
parent to `pending`). The derived percentage is what "auto percentage on
parent tasks" means.

**Auto-completion is asymmetric between the two derived-vs-declared kinds,
and this is deliberate:**

- `subtasks` reaching 100% (every direct child `complete`) **promotes the
  parent to `complete` automatically.** This is a verified fact — if every
  child is done, the parent claiming otherwise would be a lie the store can
  see through — so the store does not wait for a human or a script to say so.
  This check re-runs on every child completion and must walk upward: completing
  a leaf can complete its parent, which can complete *its* parent, and so on.
  Implement this as a single `recomputeAncestors(taskID)` walk after any
  status write, not as a special case bolted onto `Complete()` alone —
  `Reopen()` and `SetProgress()` can also change whether a parent's derived
  condition holds.
- `percentage` reaching 100 **does not** auto-complete. It's a claim, not a
  verified fact, and the store has no way to distinguish "I meant it" from
  "I typed 100 out of habit." Completing is a separate, explicit action
  (`space` in the TUI, `farol <id>` on the CLI) even at 100%.
  If this surprises a future contributor enough to want to change it, that's
  a product decision to raise, not a bug to silently fix — it was chosen
  specifically to keep the one auto-promotion path (verified subtask
  completion) the only one, rather than accumulating several slightly
  different auto-complete triggers that a reader has to hold in their head.

**Completing cascades down; reopening does not.** Marking a task `complete`
(`space`, or `farol <id>`) sets every descendant, at every depth,
to `complete` too — a `complete` task with a `pending` grandchild is a state
this app does not allow to exist, because the two-list split (§6) would then
have to explain why a "done" tree still has visibly undone rows in it.
Reopening a task (`farol reopen <id>`, or `space` again on an already
complete task) does **not** cascade to children — it returns *only that task*
to `pending`. This is intentionally lossy: the task's prior `progress_kind`
and `progress_pct` are not restored, because tracking "what it was before
completion, one level deep" is a second piece of state for a rare path
(un-completing) that would otherwise need its own tests and its own edge
cases (what if it was `subtasks`-derived and a child changed while it sat
complete?). If this bites someone in practice, revisit it — but start from
`pending`, not from resurrected history.

**Agent activity is orthogonal to this machine.** A task or list can be claimed by an agent (auto-claimed on every task write that leaves a task behind — status, progress, comment, add, edit and grab — but **not** `delete_task`, which would claim a row that no longer exists; the durable, explicit grab is `assign_task`, §9) without changing its `status` — the claim is a UI signal (the agent's name rendered in the task row, not a spinner animation), not a state transition. Claiming a task does not move it from `pending` to `in_progress`; completing a task does not release an agent's claim. When the present agent is also the durable assignee, the row de-dupes the two so the name is not printed twice: the presence unit already names the agent, so the `@tag` assignee badge is suppressed (backlog: "hermes @hermes" must not render the name twice). Status and progress writes by the same agent refresh (extend) its live claim's `acquired_at` — a write-heartbeat; they never create or release claims. **A grab is a task write, so `assign_task` and `next_task` auto-claim the task they hand you**, and the payload they return already reports `assignee_live: true`: without that, an agent would read its own just-grabbed task back as abandoned by the §3 rule below, and the TUI's stale tier would light up on work nobody has let go of. `assign_task(release=true)` is the opposite — letting go — and claims nothing. The `AgentActivity` table stores which agent is on which entity and when; it is read by the same 1s poll that reads lists and tasks (§7), but it does not interact with the status machine above. Claims expire after `WorkTTL` (120s) of inactivity; the agent front end also calls `store.ReleaseAgentClaims` when the agent's session ends (process exit), so the exiting agent's own spinners vanish immediately rather than waiting for TTL, while other agents' claims remain unaffected.

**Assignment is a third axis, orthogonal to both the status machine and presence.** `Task.assignee` (§2) has no TTL and no background sweeper — it changes only when someone explicitly assigns, unassigns or completes the task (§9 `assign_task` / `next_task`), **or when the session holding it ends**. It is not the same thing as the spinner above: presence says an agent is at the keyboard *right now*; assignment says who *owns* this work. **An assignment lives for the session that made it.** An agent session's identity is unique to its process unless `FAROL_AGENT` pins it (§9), so a tag that will never return must not hold work forever: on shutdown the server releases its own claims and its own assignments, and removes the Inbox it auto-created if that Inbox is empty. Completing a task auto-unassigns it and every descendant the cascade completes — one less step for an agent to forget.

That leaves exactly one way for an assignment to outlive its owner: a session killed hard enough that it never runs its shutdown path. That case is what the reads and the TUI still describe — **`assignee != ''` and no live presence claim (`assignee_live: false`) means the work is abandoned**, and it is the only signal the stale-assignment tier needs. Nothing auto-releases it: reads report enough for a human to decide, and the human releases it from the TUI, per task or per list. Expect that tier to be rare rather than routine.

**The store owns every transition.** None of the above should be duplicated
in both `store` and `cli` (or `store` and `components`). `store.Complete`,
`store.Reopen`, `store.SetProgress` are the only three functions that write
`status`/`progress_kind`/`progress_pct`, and every caller — CLI subcommand or
TUI keypress handler — goes through them. There is exactly one write path per
kind of change; the invariant is enforced by Go visibility (these three are
the only exported mutators), which is what makes it hold without anyone
having to remember it.

## 4. Adding a task: the level rules

The inline create row — a card spliced into the tree itself, not a pinned
footer — adds a task relative to whatever is selected in the tree. Call the selected task's depth `L` (root-level tasks are `L = 0`).
Before the input is submitted, `[` (outdent) and `]` (indent) change **where** the new
task lands, and the input's leading glyph and indentation reflect the current
choice:

| Keystrokes so far | New task's parent | New task's depth | Glyph |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none (default) | selected task's parent (i.e., a sibling of the selection) | `L` | `-` |
| one `]` | the selected task itself | `L + 1` | `+` |
| one `[` (only if `L > 0`) | the selected task's parent's parent | `L - 1` | `^` |

Further presses in the same direction **do not go further** — the range is
clamped to exactly one level either side of the selection, always. This is
the literal rule ("one level deeper, one level above") and it is a clamp, not
a wrap: pressing `]` three times behaves the same as pressing it once.
`[` is a no-op (not an error, not a beep) when `L = 0`, because there
is no level above root.

Where the new task is **inserted** among its new siblings: immediately after
the reference task that determined its parent (the selection itself for the
default and `tab` cases; the selection's parent for the `shift+tab` case).
This keeps rapid entry predictable — hitting `enter` repeatedly at the
default level appends a flat run of siblings in the order typed, which is the
behavior anyone coming from Workflowy or a plain bullet list already expects.

**State resets, every time.** After a successful add, selection moves to the
newly created task, and the level state resets to default (`-`,
sibling-of-whatever-is-now-selected) — it does not stay at `+` just because
the last add was a child. Selecting a *different* task (arrow keys, `j`/`k`,
mouse if that ever lands) while the input has unsent text also resets the
level to default for the newly selected task; the level indicator describes
a relationship to the *current* selection, and an old relationship to a task
that's no longer selected would be meaningless. `esc` while the input has
text clears the text and resets the level, and does nothing else — the input
itself never hides, unlike a modal, so `esc` here has exactly one job.

## 5. Navigation and focus

Two keyboard focus targets, not three — this app
has a sidebar that can be entirely absent from the cycle:

- **Lists panel** — present in the cycle only while *rendered* (`L` toggles
  the preference; see §6). `listsPanelVisible` is the user's stored preference;
  a separate derived predicate, `listsPanelRendered()` (preference on **and**
  the layout gave it width this frame), decides whether it actually occupies
  the row — and that predicate, not the raw preference, governs focus, the
  footer, and rendering, so focus can never land on a zero-width panel. On the
  **first** window-size message the preference is seeded from terminal width:
  Lists auto-shows at `AUTO_SHOW_LISTS_MIN_WIDTH` (120 columns) or wider and
  starts hidden below it — spending your time in one list is still the premise,
  but a wide terminal has room for both. That seeding happens once; afterward
  `L` is the sole authority and a resize never reverses a toggle — but `L` is
  not the only way to flip `listsPanelVisible` off. The Lists panel is a
  transient picker: committing a list with **`enter`** and cancelling with
  **`esc`** (see the esc precedence order below) both close it and move focus
  to Tasks exactly as `L` would, through the same `closeListsPanel` path
  (`src/model/Update.go`) — so a `enter`/`esc` close is indistinguishable from
  an `L` close afterward, including staying closed across a later resize.
  Selecting a list moves the highlight live as the cursor moves (no store
  write), so `enter`/`esc` never need to change *which* list is active —
  only whether the panel is in the way. When the
  terminal is too narrow for any sidebar (`MIN_PANEL_WIDTH + BODY_GUTTER_WIDTH`)
  Lists yields its width without changing the preference and focus falls back
  to Tasks; it reappears on a later resize if the preference is still on.
  Opening it by width never steals focus — the first focus is always Tasks.
- **Task tree** — the Tasks surface's Pending/Complete sections, one flat
  keyboard-navigable cursor across both (see §6 for why the split is visual
  section headers, not two independently-focusable lists). Inline creation
  lives inside the tree, so there is no separate add-input focus zone.

The body pairs **Tasks** with *at most one* side surface — **Lists** — the two
body shapes are Tasks alone or Tasks + Lists. When Lists is hidden, Tasks fills
the body width; when it shows, a tier-2 gutter separates the two equal-height
surfaces. Tasks is elevated while the task tree has keyboard focus. Moving focus
between surfaces must not change the Tasks surface's title, padding, gap, or
dimensions.

**Details is a modal, not a body surface.** Opening Details (`enter` on a
selected task, §5's key list) layers a centered modal over the body — sized to
most of the screen (about 90% of each axis) — and takes focus so its keys own
the keyboard while it is up; closing it (clean `esc`, a discarded edit, or a
completed save) restores focus to the task tree. It does **not** disturb the
Lists/Tasks split beneath it: the body layout is unchanged while the modal is
open, and it never takes a body column (`DetailsWidth` is always 0). Details is
never in the `tab`/`shift+tab` focus cycle — it is entered and left by the
explicit open/close transitions. It was briefly a thin side surface; that could
never be made wide enough to show notes and comments without crushing the Tasks
list beside it, so it is a modal again.

Inside the Details modal the notes textarea grows with its content but is capped
so at least one or two comment cards stay visible — notes never swallow the
whole modal. It renders **no line-number gutter**: that is a code-editor
affordance, and these notes are a few lines of prose nobody cites by line, so
the column only spent width and made the field read as an editor pane. The
`┃` prompt is the field's left edge; the line the cursor is on lifts to
`BackgroundElevated` while Notes holds the keyboard (§12). A note taller than
the cap **opens on its first line**, with the cursor parked there — a reader
opening a note starts at its beginning, and typing lands where the cursor is
visible rather than off-screen at the end. The comment thread renders as selectable cards (the shared row-card
chrome, §12); `↑`/`↓` move the highlight and `y` copies the highlighted
comment's id to the system clipboard.

**farol has three top-level pages — Active, Archived, and Search — switched
with `1`, `2`, and `3` (`keys.Global.PageActive`/`PageArchived`/
`PageSearch`) — a digit-tab header styled after `../cais`'s mainmenu.** The
header renders all three tabs at all times, digit-prefixed (`1 Active`,
`2 Archived`, `3 Search`), the selected one lifted with the same accent `▌`
bar cais's `tabLabel` uses. **`F`** (`keys.Global.Picker`) is an alias for
`3`: the picker's original binding, kept because search-as-a-verb predates
its tab and muscle memory asks for it from any surface. The digits work
from any page whenever no text input owns the keyboard — including from
inside another page, where they are the way out — the same "the digit
always jumps there" contract cais's `pageForNavKey` establishes, not a
toggle limited to opening from Active. On the Search page the digits win
over the query input: they are matched by the page's own handler ahead of
the default printable branch, so a query can never contain a digit — the
digit contract applied uniformly, not a search exception. The current
page is one enum value (`PageActive`/`PageArchived`/`PageSearch`) in
AppModel, not a lattice of booleans: exactly one page renders at a time,
and adding a page is one new value, not one new flag threaded through
every check.

**The Archive page is a full-body takeover, not a modal.** Unlike Details it
does not layer a centered box over the body: while the current page is
Archived, `renderBody()` returns the Archive page's own `View` in place of the
Tasks/Lists split entirely — the same "one surface replaces the whole row"
shape Tasks-alone already has with Lists hidden, not a second thing
composited on top of it. This is why neither of this section's opening
claims changes: Archive is not a third tab-cycle target (it is entered and
left by the explicit `2`/`1`/close transitions, exactly like Details, never
by `tab`), and it is not a second side surface either (it *replaces* the row
Tasks and Lists would otherwise occupy, rather than sharing it). It owns the
keyboard the same way Details does — AppModel intercepts every keypress
ahead of the normal dispatch and routes it to the page exclusively, right
after the Details check and before the ordinary `esc`-handling `switch` — so
no global key, task-tree binding, or Lists panel key acts while it is open;
only its own bindings (`keys.ArchivePageKeys`: `↑`/`↓`/`g`/`G` navigate, `tab`/
`shift+tab` (`FocusPreview`) switch which of the two columns those navigate
keys act on, `/` filters by name, `u` unarchives the selected list with no
confirmation, `d` opens the same confirmmodal `Lists.Delete` uses to
permanently delete one) plus `esc` and `Global.PageActive` (`1`) are live, and
the footer bar goes blank the same way it does for Details — the page renders
its own hint line in the space that would otherwise sit empty. `1` is a
second way off the page besides `esc`'s ladder below: `archivepage`'s own
`handleKey` matches it directly (after the filtering guard, so `1` typed into
the name filter still lands there) and emits the same `CloseArchivePageMsg`
a second `esc` would.
The list column and the read-only task preview beside it split the body row
the way `../cais`'s `backuppage` does, though the outer page-switching
mechanism deliberately does *not* copy `cais`'s `AppModel.pages` map. The
state under the tabs was a single boolean mirroring `detailsPanelVisible`'s
own shape while there were two pages; the Search page made it a three-value
enum instead — still a closed set with no dynamic registration, which is the
part of cais's registry this app still does not need (four-or-more pages,
pages constructed on demand). Only the header's tab *rendering* borrows
cais's look.

**The two columns scroll independently, each keyed off `previewFocused`
rather than a second focus zone AppModel knows about.** `tab`/`shift+tab`
inside the page are entirely local to `archivepage` — they never reach
AppModel's own `Global.NextPanel`/`PrevPanel` cycle, since the page
intercepts every keypress first (this is what the previous paragraph's "not
a third tab-cycle target" means: no *AppModel*-level zone changes hands).
With exactly two columns, `previewFocused` is a bool, not an enum, and both
keys just flip it — there is no third state to cycle through. `↑`/`↓`/`j`/`k`
and `g`/`G`/`home`/`end` read that bool: with it false (the default) they
move the archived-list selection exactly as before, loading a fresh preview
on every change; with it true they instead move `previewScroll`, a plain
viewport offset with no selection of its own, leaving the archived-list
selection — and therefore what `u`/`d` act on — untouched. Pressing `/`
always drops `previewFocused` back to false first, since the filter row it
opens lives in the list column. Neither column had a working scrollbar
before this: the list column silently clipped rows past its height with no
way to reach them, and the preview column showed a static "N more" line
instead of letting the user actually see the rest. `Model.listScroll` follows
the selection with the minimal-shift window `clampWindowStart` computes (the
same idea as the task tree's own `clampScroll`, adapted from lines to this
column's fixed two-line rows); `Model.previewScroll` is clamped to bounds by
`clampScrollOffset` after every `Update` rather than driven by a selection.
Both are recomputed by an exported `Update` wrapper around an unexported
`update` so no call site has to remember to reclamp after a resize, a filter
keystroke, or a fresh preview load — one place owns keeping them in range,
mirroring the task tree's own `scrollFor` being the one place that advances
`scrollOffset`.

**A search result from an archived list reveals the list and task here rather
than jumping the active list (see the Search page below).** An archived list
cannot be the active list, so Enter on such a result emits
`OpenArchivedTaskMsg`; AppModel opens the page and hands it a
`RevealArchivedTaskMsg`. The page selects the result's archived list (scrolling
the list column to it when it sits below the fold — `clampWindowStart` positions
the window the same way a below-fold selection does), loads that list's preview,
and once the preview arrives marks the exact task with an accent left bar plus a
bold primary title (`chrome.BarColumn` and the preview row's own status glyphs,
the same "this is the one" cue the task tree's selected row uses; the preview
otherwise has no selection concept since the columns are read-only). The
preview scrolls to keep the marked task visible. If the task is no longer in
the list the page simply shows the normal read-only preview — the mark degrades
to nothing rather than pointing at a stale row.

Archive's `esc` is its own ladder before it ever reaches AppModel's, and it
mirrors the tree's own `/`-filter exactly rather than inventing a new shape:
`esc` clears the name filter in one step, whether it is still being typed or
was already applied by an earlier `enter` (`enter` alone commits — blurs the
input, leaves the filtered view active — the same split the tree's filter
makes). Only a further `esc`, with nothing left to clear, emits
`CloseArchivePageMsg` and returns focus to the task tree. Put together with
the checks above it, the full precedence a keypress meets is: a modal (if one
is open) first, then Details (if open) handles its own `esc` internally (the
dirty-discard prompt, then a clean close), then the Archive page (if open)
runs the clear-then-close ladder just described (or the `1` shortcut past
it), and only once none of those apply does AppModel's own `switch` on
`Global.Back` run — a focused child's own `KeepsEsc` (the tree or Lists
panel's filter) claims it before
the Lists panel's own open/close fallback does. The pages are mutually
exclusive by the enum, so which page check runs is not an ordering question;
that the page tier sits below Details and above the switch is.

**The Search page is a full-body takeover the same way Archive is — it is
the cross-list picker (`F`) promoted from a modal to a page.** It used to be
the largest `activeModal`: a near-full-terminal centered box that blanked
the footer, painted its own private hint line, snapshotted the terminal size
at open, and re-derived its chrome arithmetic by hand. Every one of those
was a cost of being a modal, not a property of search, so the page form
removes them by construction instead of patching each: the top menu bar and
the bottom keybinding bar stay visible around it; the footer stays live and
advertises its keys like any page's; sizing comes from the same
`SetBodyLayoutMsg` broadcast every body surface takes, so a resize while it
is open reflows it; and none of its layout constants are hand-subtracted.
Like Archive it is not a tab-cycle target and not a side surface — it
replaces the body row entirely, is entered by `3` or `F` and left by `esc`
or another digit, and receives every keypress through the same page-capture
tier this section already describes.

A text input at the top searches every list live — archived lists included
— ranking title matches before notes-only hits, each result shown as
`<list> › <task>`. `↑`/`↓` walk the results (`j`/`k` stay query characters
because the input owns them). `enter` on a result jumps to that task —
switching to Active and the result's list when it lives on an active list,
opening the Archived page and revealing the list + task there when it lives
on an archived one (see the reveal behavior above). `esc` closes the page
onto Active: search is a visit, not a destination, and remembering which
page it was opened from buys nothing over two digits that already jump
anywhere. `3` is live on every page like its fellow digits — on Search
itself the page's own handler matches it ahead of the input and re-opens
idempotently. `F` is live on the two other pages the same way — on
Archived, whose capture owns every keypress, the page's `handleKey` matches
it exactly as it matches `1` — but while Search is open `F` falls through
to the input as a printable query character, so titles like `Farol v0.4`
stay searchable: the alias opens the page; it does not take a character
away from its query.

The query, results, and cursor **persist while the app runs**: leaving and
re-entering shows the search as you left it, and every poll refresh re-runs
a non-empty query so the result list cannot go stale behind the cursor. A
fresh-input-every-open surface was honest when it lived for one
keystroke-to-enter; a page that resets itself reads as broken. Zero results
render the recessed-card empty state (§12); a store error renders inline in
the same tier the Details modal draws its errors in (§12).

The page lays out as a single column today, but composes its width the way
Archive splits its two columns: a read-only preview of the selected result
is the anticipated second column, and nothing in the layout may assume the
results own the full width. The footer advertises the live keys — navigate,
open, back — derived from the page's bindings in `src/keys`, replacing the
private hint line; the help overlay gains no new scope, because nothing on
the page is invisible, and a scope exists for keys a reader must plan around
before reaching their surface, not for controls advertised where they live
(see the catalog rules below).

`tab`/`shift+tab` cycle **only through the targets currently visible** —
the lists panel is skipped entirely from the cycle while hidden
(`focusableZones()` in `src/model/Update.go` computes the cycle at runtime)
rather than being a focusable-but-inert stop. Do not implement "hidden but
still tab-able to an invisible panel"; that produces a focus ring with a
silent dead stop in it. The footer follows the same rule: with no side panel
open the cycle is a single zone, so the keybinding bar does not advertise
tab/shift+tab (a dead hint: nothing to cycle), and the hints return the
moment the lists panel opens (`GlobalsFor`/`Active` in `src/keys/Keys.go`
drop the pair on `ListsPanelVisible == false`).

`[`/`]` restructure the *selected* task — not just the create-mode level
selector (§4). Outdent `[` (move the selected task out from under its
parent, becoming the parent's next sibling) and indent `]` (move it under
its previous sibling, as that sibling's last child); both are no-ops at
their boundaries (a root task cannot be outdented; a first sibling has
nothing to hang under). Indent additionally obeys §3: a pending task never
moves under a complete sibling. While the inline create input is active the
same two keys are the create-mode level selector (§4) instead. **While the
inline create input is live, creating a task focuses only the text input:**
`tab`/`shift+tab` do NOT cycle focus to another panel and `?` types a literal
instead of opening help, so a half-typed title can never be stranded on
another panel mid-entry. `esc` is the way out (it cancels, or parks on an
empty list). Once the input is parked or closed, tab cycles the panels again
as usual. The same single-active-element rule holds visually: while the
create row is on screen, no task row draws the selected treatment (accent
bar, ModalBg, accent spinner) — the previously selected task keeps its
selection state but renders unselected, so the input is the only "selected"
thing on the panel. The highlight returns the moment the input closes. This
reversed an earlier design ("tab keeps cycling even while the
create row has the keyboard") — the cycle itself was harmless, but focus
leaving the input mid-entry was a constant footgun during rapid task entry,
and the draft-preservation it relied on was invisible state. The tree is the
startup focus and is broadcast as such at startup (phase-3 Init), so its keys
work from the first frame rather than only after a focus change.

**Vim and arrow bindings both work, always, on the task tree:** `↑`/`k` up,
`↓`/`j` down (moving the cursor across every *visible* row — a collapsed
node's children are not visible rows and are skipped), `←`/`h` collapses the
selected node if it has children and is expanded, else moves selection to its
parent; `→`/`l` expands the selected node if it has children and is
collapsed, else moves selection to its first child. This is the same
convention as `nnn`, `lf`, and most terminal file managers with a tree pane —
picked because it is already muscle memory for the audience, not invented
for this app.

**Collapse is deep; expand is shallow — two halves of one invariant, not
independently choosable.** Collapsing a node hides its *entire* subtree,
every depth, not just its direct children: every descendant's own collapse
state is set at the same time (`tasktree.collapseDeep`), walking forward
through `m.rows`' depth-first preorder while `Depth` stays greater than the
collapsed node's own. Expanding a node reveals *only* its direct children —
grandchildren stay collapsed, and have to be expanded themselves to appear.
**Collapsing resets, it does not remember**: a descendant's collapsed flag is
set unconditionally, never preserved from before, so a later shallow expand
of an ancestor can never reveal more than exactly one level — not "however
many levels happened to be open before that ancestor was collapsed." The
alternative (each node remembers its own expansion state across a collapse)
was considered and rejected: it would make expand's behavior depend on
history the user can't see — sometimes revealing one level, sometimes six —
which is precisely the inconsistency the shallow-expand rule exists to
remove. This decision is final; a future contributor proposing "restore
prior expansion on re-expand" is proposing the rejected alternative, not a
new idea. If the currently selected row is a descendant hidden by a
collapse, selection moves to the collapsed node itself — the nearest row
that stayed visible — rather than pointing at a row no longer on screen.

**`g`** jumps the cursor to the first row and **`G`** to the last,
**`pgup`** and **`pgdown`** move it one viewport height up/down (clamped to
the row bounds). `home`/`g` and `end`/`G` are both accepted, and `pgup`/
`pgdown` mirror the lists panel's `ListKeyMap()` so the two panels agree on
movement — `left`/`right` are deliberately **not** borrowed here, since the
tree reserves them for expand/collapse (§5).

**`alt+↑`/`alt+k` and `alt+↓`/`alt+j` move the selected task** up or down
*within its own status run* — the gesture never crosses the Pending/Complete
boundary, so a task cannot be moved out of the section it belongs in
without being crushed or un-crushed first (§3, §6). The modifier choice
follows vim's `alt+k`/`alt+j` convention (a plain `k`/`j` moves the cursor;
`alt` makes it move the *thing under* the cursor, the same handshape VS
Code's `alt+↑`/`alt+↓` uses for moving lines) — one key with a modifier,
not a second unmodified key that would steal a character vim users expect
to type.

**`u` releases the selected task's assignment, and `U` releases every
assignment in the active list.** Assignment has **no TTL and no background
sweeper** (§3): a session releases its own work on the way out, so these two
keys are the only thing in the app that frees a task whose agent went away
*without* getting to run its shutdown path — which is why the stale tier
(§12) marks such a task rather than the app quietly reclaiming it. The
release is **unconditional**: it clears an assignment held by any agent, since
a stale one is by definition held by someone who is not the person at the
keyboard, and a release that refused a foreign holder would leave abandoned
work stuck forever. `u` prompts for nothing — nothing is destroyed and
re-assigning restores it — while `U` goes through the same confirm modal every
other bulk action uses (§9), with the dialog counting the assignments it is
about to clear; it can free work several agents hold at once. The shifted form
takes the whole-list action, the same way `L` takes the panel-wide one over
the tree's own `l`. The tree only asks (`UnassignTaskMsg` / `ReleaseListMsg`);
AppModel calls `store.UnassignTask` / `store.UnassignList` and refreshes,
the same request/response split `space` and `d` use.

**`space` toggles complete/pending** on the selected task, from wherever the
tree has focus — it does not open anything and does not move the cursor.
**`enter`** on a selected tree row opens the Details modal — so it can't
also mean "toggle complete"; the two are deliberately different keys because
"open a thing" and "flip a checkbox" are different enough actions that
collapsing them into one key is what makes an app feel like a demo rather
than a tool. When one key serves two surfaces it is tempting to alias it to
both verbs, but here the verbs genuinely differ, so they are two different
bindings from the start rather than one alias split apart later.

Inside the Details modal: **`ctrl+s`** saves title, notes, progress and
priority changes,
closes the modal, returns focus to the task tree, and refreshes its rows;
**`tab`**/**`shift+tab`** cycle between the title editor, the notes editor, the
progress selector, the priority selector, the comment thread, and the
attachment list (every zone is always in the cycle —
the comment thread is reachable even while empty, since `c` adds the first
comment from there); **`←`/`→`** (or `h`/`l`) cycle through the three progress
modes (`simple`/`subtasks`/`percentage`) while the progress selector is focused —
the modal shows those modes under plain-language labels ("in progress (flag)",
"from subtasks", "percentage"), never their stored names, which stay the CLI
vocabulary (§9); in `percentage` mode **digits** type the value directly and
**`↑`/`↓`** step it by 5, clamped to 0–100 (typed input reports an out-of-range
error instead of clamping — the user can see what they typed, unlike a held
arrow key), and both affordances are advertised in the modal's hint line only
while that mode is selected, since neither does anything in the other two;
**`←`/`→`** (or `h`/`l`) cycle the **priority** through the four values §2
locks while the priority selector is focused — in rank order
(`none` → `low` → `medium` → `high`), wrapping, so `→` always means "more
important" until it comes back round; it is one binding
(`keys.Details.CyclePriority`) carrying both directions, because a four-step
rank with no way back is a control the user has to loop three times to undo.
The zone shows `none` where the task row's badge shows nothing (§12): a field
being edited has to display the value it holds. The rank is written through
`store.SetPriority` on `ctrl+s` and **only when it changed** — that store
function rejects the zero value and bumps `updated_at`, so a save that touched
only the title must not write the priority at all;
**`↑`/`↓`** move the comment highlight, **`y`** copies the highlighted
comment's id to the system clipboard, and **`d`** deletes it — routed through
the same confirm modal every other destructive action uses (§9), with the
dialog quoting the comment's own text so the highlight can never be
mistaken — while the comment thread is focused; the attachment list works the
same way one field narrower: **`↑`/`↓`** (or `k`/`j`) move the highlight and
**`d`** deletes the highlighted attachment through the same confirm modal,
while the attachment list is focused — there is no key to *add* an
attachment, since attaching (a local path, stdin, or a downloaded URL) is a
CLI-only action (`farol attach`); **`ctrl+y`** copies the open
task's id from any zone (a TUI has no reliable text
selection under mouse reporting, so the id is shown below the title and a key is
the real copy affordance); `esc` closes a clean modal immediately, and on a dirty
one shows the inline `Discard changes? (y/n)` prompt — `y` closes and discards,
`n` keeps editing. **`enter` is deliberately unbound at that prompt**: the
confirm modal can bind it because it has a visible yes/no selection for `enter`
to act on, and this prompt has none, so binding it would leave unsaved edits one
stray keystroke from gone. The help overlay lists the prompt's own `y`/`n` entry
for that reason, rather than letting the Overlays scope's "enter confirm" — true
of the modals that do have that selection — imply it works here too. No path
silently discards edits. The label of the focused zone
(Title/Notes/Progress/Priority/Comments/Attachments) is bolded onto `TextPrimary`, the focused field
itself lifts to `BackgroundElevated` (§12), and every footer hint bolds its key
ahead of a muted description.

While the modal is open the **global footer renders nothing at all** — a blank
full-width bar, so the layout height does not move. The modal carries its own
hint line beside the controls it describes, and that line is the only one on
screen; it never spells its own wording, taking every hint from the binding in
`src/keys` so the modal and the help overlay cannot describe a key two ways.
A key is advertised only in the zone where it is actually live.

That line is always exactly one row. The modal's content column is fixed-width,
so a hint line too long to fit would wrap and grow the modal by a row; whole
hints shed from the tail instead, the same way the footer bar sheds (§5). Each
zone therefore lists its hints in priority order — the ways out of the zone
(`tab`, `esc`), then how to commit (`ctrl+s`), then the input methods for the
value the zone edits, then the extras — so what a narrow terminal drops is what
a user stuck in that zone would need last.

The task **title** is an editable single-line `textinput`, first in the tab
cycle; a save writes it through `store.RenameTask`, and a title cleared to
whitespace is refused in place (the store forbids an empty title) rather than
closing on a write that would fail.

Adding a comment is an **inline compose card**, opened with **`c`** from the
comment thread — the same "fake card while adding" shape the task tree uses for
inline task creation. The card renders at the foot of the thread styled like the
selected comment card, showing the OS author and a single-line `textinput`. That
input paints on the **card's** tier (`BackgroundElevated`), never the modal's —
it has no bare-modal row to sit on, and sealing it onto `ModalBg` cuts a
modal-coloured stripe through the card that reads as the card being broken. Both
sides take that tier from one place so they cannot drift apart.
**`enter`** posts it and **`esc`** cancels (a terminal cannot reliably
distinguish `ctrl+enter` from `enter`, so `enter` is the submit key — `ctrl+enter`
is accepted as an alias). Comments are short status/handoff notes, so one line is
sufficient. The compose draft is **transient**:
it is not part of the task's saved fields, so `ctrl+s` never posts it and `esc`
on the modal (outside the card) needs no discard prompt for it. While the card is
open the draft survives a poll refresh — the input is cleared only when the card
closes — so a background refresh can no longer wipe a half-typed comment. Posting
a comment appends it to the visible thread immediately (no modal reload); the next
refresh reconciles the authoritative ordering. Below the progress zone, each
comment renders as a selectable card in the shared row-card chrome (§12) — a
`{author} · {timestamp}` header in `TextDim`, a blank spacer, then the note in
`TextPrimary` wrapped to the card width, oldest first — with the highlighted card
lifted onto the elevated tier under an accent bar. The comment write path goes
through `store.AddComment`, which enforces the per-list `comments_disabled` flag
and surfaces its error as an inline message rather than posting.

**`/?`** enters a local fuzzy filter, and its target follows focus: the
**task tree** filter (phase 8) narrows the current list's rows in place to
each match plus its ancestor chain, so a matched leaf never loses its
parent rows; the **lists panel** filter narrows the visible lists the same
way. The filter is **live**: it re-narrows on every keystroke, the way `F`
does, so the query never sits typed-but-inert waiting on a commit. `enter`
still applies the query — it blurs the input and leaves the filtered view
active so the cursor can walk the results — and `esc` clears it. The two
states differ only in where the keyboard is, never in what is on screen.

**`F`** opens the cross-list **Search page** (phase 8, originally a modal)
— an alias for the `3` tab, kept for the picker's original muscle memory:
a text input searches every list live — archived lists included — ranking
title matches before notes-only hits, and showing each result as
`<list> › <task>`. An **active** list's name is styled exactly like its task
title (the two read as one label); only an **archived** list's name is drawn
in `TextDim` and suffixed with `*`, with a one-line `* archived list` legend
appearing whenever the current result set contains one. Matched characters
inside a result's title draw in `Accent` — the same "this is what the
keyboard found" register the selection bar uses (§12). `enter` on a result
jumps to that task — switching to Active and the result's list when the
match lives on an active list — but a result from an **archived** list
cannot become the active list, so instead it opens the Archived page and
reveals the list + task there (see §5). `esc` closes the page onto Active.
The full page contract — persistence, layout, the footer carrying the hints
— lives in the Search page section above; the fixed-at-open result-area
sizing died with the modal, because a page reflows from the layout broadcast
like every other body surface.

**`d` deletes the selected task** (or list, when the lists panel is focused),
prompting for confirmation first (docs/DESIGN.md §9: destructive TUI ops need
a confirm modal). The tree emits `DeleteTaskMsg`; AppModel opens a confirm modal;
accepting runs `store.DeleteTask` and refreshes the rows. List delete
(`L` panel, `d`) follows the same confirm-modal pattern.

**`e` exports the store or the highlighted list** to a JSON file (the same
store-level `Export` the CLI uses, §9). When the Lists panel is focused and a
list is highlighted, `e` opens the export modal defaulted to "this list"; when
no list is highlighted (or toggled via tab+space), it defaults to "whole store".
The user types a destination path and confirms; the modal marshals the
`ExportDocument` and writes the file. Failures route through `lastError`, the
same channel a failed delete uses.

**`i` imports lists from a JSON file** (the same `ImportList` the CLI uses, §9).
It opens an import modal that takes a source file path; on confirm it parses
the versioned document and recreates each list additively with fresh ids,
matching the CLI's `farol import <file>`. The imported lists appear in the
Lists panel on refresh; existing data is never overwritten. Bad path, an
unparseable file, or a version mismatch surfaces through `lastError`.

**`q` quits, and `ctrl+c` always quits.** `q` is the ordinary exit and
`ctrl+c` the escape hatch that yields to nothing — so both are advertised as
"quit" rather than one of them as "force quit", which made the only documented
way out sound like an emergency. Because `q` is a printable character it is
handled *after* everything that could be typing one: a modal or the Details
modal owns the keyboard and swallows it; the inline create row and a `/` filter
being typed both take it as a literal `q`; and it quits only from the task tree
or the lists panel with none of those active. That is the same precedence
`keys.Active` already uses to decide what is live, so what the footer
advertises and what `q` does cannot drift apart. There is no "really quit?"
confirmation: every write is already on disk (§8), so leaving costs nothing.
`q` is deliberately left unbound on the lists panel's inner bubbles list
(`ListKeyMap()`), so the global handler is the only thing that answers to it.

**`?` opens the help overlay, and it lists EVERY key in the app on every
screen.** Not the keys live on the screen it was opened from — the whole
catalog, always the same scopes in the same order, built by `keys.Catalog` from
the same binding structs the handlers match against. Keys the user cannot press
right now are **dimmed** rather than omitted, and the overlay carries a legend
saying so, since a dimmed row otherwise reads as "removed" rather than "not
here".

The scopes came and went with the context once — `Lists` only while the lists
panel was visible, `Task Tree` only with an active list, `Creating`/`Filter`/
`Task Tree` as three mutually exclusive branches. That makes the overlay
useless for its actual job: a key you can only read about once you have already
found the surface it belongs to is not documented at all. The same failure, in
its worst form, is what shipped — `n` (new task) was bound, handled, advertised
in the footer and named by the empty state, but appeared nowhere in the overlay,
so help taught a reader how to create a *list* and not how to create a *task*.
`src/components/helpoverlay/coverage_test.go` reflects over every keymap
struct the catalog documents and fails if any binding is missing from the
rendered overlay; that guard, not review discipline, is what keeps this true.

Each scope renders one key/description **per line**, not packed side-by-side
and wrapped — a scope with several keys used to read as a run-on paragraph
once it wrapped past one line. The catalog is also narrowable with the same
`/`-fuzzy filter the task tree uses (`keys.Global.Filter`), matching each
entry's key and description text; a scope with no matching entry disappears
entirely rather than leaving an empty heading, so filtering never breaks the
section separation described above.

A scope exists for keys a reader has to be able to plan around before
reaching their surface, not for every modal that owns a keyboard. Modals
whose controls are visible once open — the list-name modal's input and
collaborative checkbox, the export/import modals' fields — advertise their
mode-specific keys on their own hint lines, where they are live; duplicating
those rows in the catalog re-teaches what the modal already says, and a
second rendering of the same key is a second wording waiting to drift. Their
generic `enter`/`esc` are the Overlays scope's rows like every overlay's.
Modals with invisible key behaviour keep a scope: Details' `ctrl+s` save, its
`y`/`n`-only discard prompt, and its zone-specific cycling cannot be read off
the screen.

Where a key does something its help text cannot carry, the scope gets a
one-line **`Note`** (`keys.Scope.Note`) — that is how `L` says it also moves
focus into the panel it reveals, and how the Overlays scope says the Details
discard prompt answers to `y`/`n` alone. Saying so in the section is the
alternative to omitting the key.

Listing the whole app is more than an 80x24 terminal holds, so the scope
content is **windowed and scrolls with `↑`/`↓`** (`keys.Overlay.Navigation`,
which every overlay already advertised for exactly this and now carries the
keystrokes to match), with the same `N above` / `N below` counts the task
tree's pinned section headers use (§12). The window height is *measured* from
the assembled chrome rather than counted from a constant, because several of
those pieces wrap at some widths and not others.

**Task renaming** in the TUI is done in the Details modal: its Title field is an
editable input (first in the tab cycle), saved with `ctrl+s` through
`store.RenameTask` — see the Details modal keys above.

**`esc` is the most overloaded key in the app** — six jobs (cancel an inline
create, clear the task-tree filter, clear the lists-panel filter, close a
modal, discard a dirty Details edit, close the Lists panel) resolved through
a strict "ladder of claims": each surface that might own esc is checked in a
fixed order, and the first one that claims it gets it. It is one switch case
(`keys.Global.Back`), checked in this order —
the order is the contract; checking it out of sequence silently breaks
whichever claim got skipped:

1. **A modal** (theme picker, confirm, list-name) closes itself first — modals
   intercept every keypress at the top of `Update`, so by the time esc
   reaches AppModel's own handling, no modal is open.
2. **The Details modal**, while visible, owns every keypress ahead of
   AppModel's normal Back case (it is tracked outside `activeModal`, for its
   poll-refresh-while-open behavior, so it sits just after the modal check).
   Its own handler takes esc: closing a clean modal, or raising the inline
   "Discard changes? (y/n)" prompt on a dirty one — once that prompt is up,
   only `y`/`n` resolve it (see the Details modal keys above).
3. **The focused panel's own `KeepsEsc` claim**: the task tree while typing
   or applying a `/` filter, or while inline-creating a task (§8); the lists
   panel while its own filter is open or applied — clearing the filter, not
   closing the panel. A user who just filtered the list must not lose the
   whole panel to their very next esc.
4. **Closing the Lists panel**, when it is focused and visible and did not
   already claim esc at step 3: `listsPanelVisible` goes false and focus
   returns to Tasks, through the same `closeListsPanel` path `enter` uses to
   commit a selection (§5 above) — the panel is a transient picker, and esc
   is its cancel. This must stay below step 3, or a filtered lists panel
   would close instead of clearing its query — the worse-bug-than-the-fix
   failure mode this ordering exists to prevent.
5. Otherwise, a no-op.

## 6. The main panel: Pending and Complete

The right panel is two sections, headed `Pending` and `Complete`, not two
independently scrollable/focusable lists. One cursor moves through both,
`Pending` first, and each section keeps its own order: the cursor walks the
*pending rows in their store order, then the complete rows in theirs*, so a
complete task sitting between two pending ones in the store (it was crushed
in place, §3) never hijacks a pending row's cursor position. Crossing the
section boundary wraps — `↓` from the last pending row lands on the first
complete row, `↑` from the first complete row returns to the last pending
row — and the two ends clamp (no wrap from before the first pending or
after the last complete). The cursor is a flat walk over the concatenation
`pending + complete`, not a per-section index; "own order" is about which
rows the walk skips, not about separate focusables (that would reintroduce
the exact dead-stop focus ring §5's tab rule forbids).

**Which section a task-tree renders under is decided by the *root* task's own
`status` alone**, not by scanning descendants: a root-level task with
`status != complete` renders (with its whole visible subtree) under
`Pending`; a root-level task with `status = complete` renders under
`Complete`. Because completing cascades to every descendant (§3), a tree
under `Complete` is, by invariant, 100% complete rows all the way down — the
section header is a true claim, not an approximation. A tree under `Pending`
can and will contain a mix: a `pending` parent can have `complete` children
sitting inline (checked, perhaps struck through) underneath it, still nested
in place. **Do not move a completed subtask out to the `Complete` section
while its parent is still pending** — that would separate a task from the
tree it belongs to for a reader trying to see the shape of remaining work,
which defeats the reason the tree exists at all.

**`v` cycles which of the two sections are shown** — both (the default),
then Pending only, then Complete only, then back to both — unchanged for
anyone who never presses it. One cycling key rather than three direct-select
digits because `1` and `2` are the top-level page-switch keys (§5); `v` is
free everywhere. This is a visibility filter over the same section model
above, not a second navigation mode: the cursor still walks the flat
`pending + complete` concatenation, just over whichever of the two the mode
leaves non-empty. Hiding a section drops its header the same way an empty
`Complete` section's header is already omitted below — filtering and natural
emptiness are the same rendering case with two different causes. The active
mode is shown in the header (mainmenu), low-emphasis, next to the version,
except while the Archive page is open — that mode describes the Active
page's task tree, which is not on screen (§5).

**`s` cycles the task tree's sort mode** — manual (the default), priority
(`high` → `medium` → `low` → `none`), created (newest first), updated (most
recent first), alpha (A–Z by title, case-insensitive), wrapping back to
manual (`apptypes.SortMode.Next`). Sorting is display-only bookkeeping:
`apptypes.SortTasks` orders a copy of the rows at render time and the mode is
neither written to the store nor persisted across launches, so an agent
reading the same list over the protocol always sees preorder position
regardless of what the human has cycled to — one client's viewing preference
cannot reorder another client's view of the work. Manual exists as a mode
rather than as the absence of one so that `s` is always a single keystroke
from wherever the tree has been left back to the canonical order. While a
non-manual mode is active the footer appends a low-emphasis `⇅ <mode>`
indicator after the global hints; manual shows nothing, because it is the
store order every other surface already renders.

A list with no tasks yet auto-shows the inline "new task" input as its only
row, under the `Pending` header — the input creates a pending task, so it
belongs to the section the task will land in — with one line of `TextDim`
guidance beneath it: **"type a title and press enter"**. The same rule holds
for a list whose tasks are all complete: the input opens under `Pending`
(even though that section is empty) rather than after the `Complete` section,
so it never sits at the bottom of the list while the task it creates lands at
the top. And a root-append draft (one with no anchor, i.e. appending at the
end of the pending section) renders its input at the end of `Pending`,
above the rule and `Complete`, for the same reason: the input always appears
in the section the new task will join.

**That is the empty list's only appearance.** `esc` *parks* the input rather
than closing it: the draft is discarded and the input is **blurred**, but the
row stays exactly where it is, so the surface renders identically before and
after esc. (An empty input draws its placeholder, not a cursor, so parked and
live are indistinguishable on screen.) `n` makes it live again.

Blurring is the part that matters beyond appearance: a live create input owns
the keyboard, and the input on an empty list can no longer be closed, so
without parking `q`, `L`, `t` and `/` would be dead forever on the first screen
a new user sees. `KeepsEsc`, `OwnsKeyboard` and `IsCreating` all key off the
*live* state, not off the row being rendered, which also keeps the footer from
advertising `enter create` for an input that would ignore it.

This replaced an earlier design in which esc swapped the input for a recessed
"No tasks yet. Press n to create one." card. One condition drew two different
screens, and the card explaining how to add a task appeared only *after* the
user dismissed the thing it was telling them to open. The guidance now sits
beside the input instead of in a card that replaces it. The `Complete`
header is omitted entirely when empty; an empty `Complete` section with
nothing under it is noise no reader needs.

**Vertical rhythm inside the sections:** one blank line separates each
section header from its first row (and from the row above it), and one
blank line sits below the last pending row before the `Complete` header —
the two sections read as two blocks instead of one unbroken column, and a
pending list's bottom edge doesn't collide with the complete header. The
blank line after a section's last row is part of the section, not the next
one: it renders even when the next section is empty.

**Scrolling is selection-driven, not a second navigation mode.** When the two
sections together are taller than the panel body, the tree renders only a
vertical window of its lines and shifts that window the minimum needed to keep
the selected row (or, mid-create, the inline input row) inside it, under the
existing `↑`/`↓`/`j`/`k` walk, plus `g`/`G` for first/last and `pgup`/`pgdown` for
one viewport-height jumps (§5) — there is no mouse wheel and no horizontal
scroll (both out of scope). The window is computed
from one **line plan** (`[]panelLine` in `tasktree`, each entry a single display
line tagged with its task id or blank for chrome) that the renderer and the
scroll math share, so header/blank/rule counts are never duplicated in the
scroll logic. The scroll offset lives in the tree model and is advanced by a
Bubble Tea update — never by rendering — after navigation, refresh, filter
change, view-mode change, collapse/expand, create start/cancel/confirm, and
a layout resize; a
resize that shrinks the panel clamps a now-too-large offset, and an empty or
no-selection state resets it to the top. The window always paints its full
height: any short remainder is filled with the panel-tier background so a
partly-filled panel never bleeds. The `Lists` panel keeps its existing
Bubbles-list scrolling unchanged — one scrolling system per panel.

## 7. Live refresh: how the TUI sees the CLI's writes

There is no daemon, no socket, no file watcher — the TUI polls.

`tea.Tick` fires every `poll_interval_ms` (config default: **1000** — a local
SQLite read costs microseconds, so there is no reason to make a human wait
several seconds to see their own agent's last completion) and dispatches a
`cmds.PollMsg`. `AppModel` responds by re-running exactly two queries — list
summaries (for the lists panel and its counts) and the active list's task
tree — and diffs the result against what's currently rendered. On no change,
nothing re-renders; Bubble Tea already no-ops a `View()` call that produces
identical output to the terminal driver, but the diff also matters for one
thing that isn't free: **cursor position**. A poll that finds the previously
selected task still present keeps the cursor on it (matched by id, not by
row index — a CLI insert or delete during the interval can move every row
index without moving the task the user was looking at). A poll that finds
the selected task gone (deleted from elsewhere) moves the cursor to the
nearest surviving row — when the ground moves, keep the user on the closest
thing to where they were, never dump the cursor to a fixed position.

**Agent activity claims are read by the same poll.** Each `RefreshLists` and `RefreshTasks` call also runs `store.ListWork()` to fetch the current set of live agent claims (entities claimed within the `WorkTTL` window). The returned `[]AgentActivity` travels with the refresh messages so the task tree and lists panel can render the agent's name on claimed rows (no spinner animation). `RefreshLists` additionally computes the set of lists with any live task claim (`ClaimedTaskListIDs`) and carries it on the message, so the lists panel shows the agent's name on a list row when an agent is working inside it — not only when the list itself is claimed. The same 1s poll tick governs both data and claims — no separate IPC or interval is needed.

**The very first load is animated, later polls are not.** `GetInitialModel`
does no database work: it constructs the components and returns immediately with
no active list, so Bubble Tea can paint the first frame before the opening
`RefreshLists` query completes. That first `RefreshListsMsg` also decides
*which* list is active: it reopens the list the user last had active, persisted
in the `Setting` table (§8) on every switch. The stored id wins when it still
exists; the first list is the fallback for a first run, an empty store, or a
stored id whose list was deleted in the meantime. The fallback choice is itself
persisted, so a relaunch never silently forgets where the user landed. Until
that first `RefreshListsMsg` arrives —
success *or* error — the Tasks panel renders a sealed `Loading` label with an
animated ellipsis (Bubbles' `spinner.Ellipsis` frames `""`, `.`, `..`, `...`,
so the animation adds no ambiguous emoji width). The animation lives only in the
`taskspanel` initial-load state; the first refresh leaves that state permanently
and no later `PollTickMsg`/`RefreshListsMsg` cycle ever restores it. The ellipsis
is drawn through a render-time `Foreground(appstyles.Active.Accent)` style read
fresh each frame — no theme color is cached on the spinner, so a live theme
switch mid-load repaints it. The empty-store default-list creation that the old
constructor did synchronously now happens on that first refresh (§5): a
successful first load still ends with an active list.

**The TUI never holds a write transaction, and no poll tick is allowed to
block on one.** It opens a read connection at startup and keeps it; every
poll is a `SELECT`, full stop. All writes — from the TUI's own keypress
handlers as much as from an external CLI invocation — go through the same
`store` functions the CLI uses (§8), each wrapping one short transaction that
opens, writes, commits, and returns, so a rapid-fire agent loop calling
farol <task-id> in a shell `for` loop is never waiting behind the TUI, and
the TUI is never waiting behind it either. SQLite's WAL mode (§8) is what
makes concurrent readers and a writer not block each other; do not disable it.

## 8. Storage and concurrency

**modernc.org/sqlite** — pure Go, no CGO. This keeps the build story simple:
`CGO_ENABLED=0`, cross-compiled linux/darwin ×
amd64/arm64 by the same GoReleaser shape (`.goreleaser.yaml` carries the
exact config forward). A CGO-based SQLite driver would be the
more common choice by download count, but it would make this the one thing
in the whole toolchain that needs a C compiler to cross-compile, for no
capability this app uses that the pure-Go driver lacks.

**One file:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/farol/farol.db` (falling back to
`~/.local/share/farol/farol.db`), opened in WAL journal mode. WAL is
what lets the TUI's long-lived read connection and a CLI process's short
write transaction coexist without either blocking the other — the default
rollback-journal mode takes an exclusive lock for the duration of a write,
which would stall the TUI's next poll for the length of the write, small as
that is. This is a one-line `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` at connection open, not
a design a contributor needs to build — but it is a design a contributor
could accidentally undo by opening the connection differently elsewhere, so:
**there is exactly one function that opens the database, `store.Open`,** and
every caller — `main.go`'s TUI path and every CLI subcommand — calls it. Do
not open a second `sql.DB` anywhere; a second connection that forgets the WAL
pragma is a subtle, load-bearing regression, not a stylistic one.

The database is **already per-OS-user**: the path derives from `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
(or `~/.local/share`), which is per-account by definition. Two OS users on the
same machine get independent databases with no extra code — the
"separate SQLite databases by user" ask is satisfied as-is, and the CLI/TUI
is not multi-tenant within one OS account.

**Migrations** are numbered `.sql` files embedded via `embed.FS`
(`store/migrations/0001_init.sql`, `0002_*.sql`, …), applied in order inside
`store.Open`, tracked by a `schema_migrations(version integer primary key)`
table. Every invocation of the binary — TUI or any CLI subcommand — runs this
before touching data, idempotently (a migration that's already applied is a
no-op, not an error). One function decides the schema is current, called from
one place (`store.Open`), rather than each caller assuming someone else
already did it — "one resolution, passed down".

**Config** (`~/.config/farol/config.yaml`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) holds
exactly two fields at launch, in a struct designed to grow — add a field,
tag it, and `LoadConfig`/`SaveConfig` round-trip it automatically:

```yaml
theme: farol-dusk
poll_interval_ms: 1000
```

Both optional; a missing file or a missing field falls back to the compiled
default, and a malformed file is reported rather than silently ignored.
The `src/config` package doc comment carries the full contract.

**App state** (as opposed to user preferences) lives in a `Setting`
key/value table in the same SQLite file (migration `0007_settings.sql`):
one row per key, values TEXT, read and written only through `store`
`GetSetting`/`SetSetting` (an upsert, like every other store mutator). The
one key today is `last_list_id`, the list the TUI reopens at startup (§7).
It is written only when the active list actually changes, never by the
poll: the poll stays a pure read, per the concurrency rule above, and a
1s-tick UPSERT would turn the TUI into a writer on every tick for no user
benefit.

## 9. The CLI contract

Built on [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). Every subcommand that reads
data accepts `--json`; every subcommand, reading or writing, reports failure
the same way regardless of `--json`. This uniformity is the whole point of
having a contract document at all — an agent that has read one subcommand's
`--help` should be able to predict the shape of every other one's output and
errors without reading the rest.

**Output shape, human mode (default):** a write command that succeeds prints
nothing but the one piece of information a script might want to capture
(`farol lists add` prints the new list's id and nothing else; `farol add` prints the new task's id and nothing else). A read command prints a
formatted table or tree to stdout. Any failure prints one line to stderr,
prefixed `farol: `, and the process exits non-zero.

**Output shape, `--json` mode:** stdout is **always exactly one JSON value**,
whether the command succeeded or failed — `{"error": "list not found:
01ARZ…"}` on failure, the command's normal payload on success. Nothing else
is written to stdout in this mode; diagnostic/progress text, if any, goes to
stderr instead. This means a caller that passes `--json` never has to check
two streams to know what happened — parse stdout, then check the exit code to
know whether what you parsed was the payload or the error. Do not print
human-readable text to stdout *alongside* the JSON "for convenience"; that
breaks every caller's parser the first time it happens.

**Exit codes:** `0` success. `1` the operation failed for a domain reason
(id not found, invalid state transition, validation failure). `2` a usage
error — Cobra's own default for a malformed flag or missing argument, left
as-is rather than remapped, since that's the exit code every other Cobra-based
tool already uses for the same thing.

**ID prefixes.** Every `<list-id>`/`<task-id>` argument accepts an
unambiguous prefix of the full ULID, resolved by `store.ResolveID` against
the relevant table. An ambiguous prefix (matches more than one row) is a
domain error (exit `1`), not a silent pick of the first match — silently
guessing which task an agent meant is exactly the kind of behavior this
project exists to not have.

**Destructive commands need `--force`.** `farol lists rm`, `farol rm`
(task), and `farol comment rm` refuse to run without `--force`. The TUI's
equivalent actions go through a confirm modal; the CLI has no modal to route
through and
no human to ask, so the flag *is* the confirmation. This is the one place
the CLI is deliberately less convenient than the TUI, on purpose: an agent's
typo in a task id should not have the blast radius of an unrecoverable
delete with no prompt at all.

**Comment deletion and its ownership rule.** Comments were append-only
(§2); `store.DeleteComment` hard-deletes by id, with no soft-delete or
tombstone. The CLI (`farol comment rm <comment-id> --force`) and the TUI
(the Details modal's comments zone) are unenforced like every other
human-facing delete — either may remove any comment. The store is
unenforced and the CLI/TUI never gate a comment delete; this is the deliberate
front-end divergence CONTRIBUTING rule 5 records. The error shape
`comment <id> is owned by <author> — you may only delete your own comments`
was the message the old agent-server gate used; it does not apply to the
CLI/TUI, which may remove any comment. The `comment` tool also merges
the old `add_comment`; deletion alone stays gated by
`requireOwnComment`, and posting a comment is never blocked by assignment.
This is a narrower rule than list
ownership: it keys off the individual comment's author, not the list's
`created_by`, so an agent can always delete its own comment even on a list
it does not own.

**Full subcommand list**, grouped by the thing they act on. `<id>` accepts a
prefix (see above) throughout.

```

**`farol inbox` is the CLI equivalent of the `farol:///inbox` resource**
(cli-first migration, parity 1.7). It is read-only and non-interactive, so it
claims no presence. It emits exactly one JSON value on stdout in `--json`
mode, of the shape:

```json
{
  "mine":          { "id", "name", "pending", "complete", "tasks": [...] },
  "foreign_lists": [ { "id", "name", "pending", "complete",
                       "created_by", "collaborative", "tasks": [...] }, ... ]
}
```

`mine` is the single list whose `created_by` equals `FAROL_AGENT`; its
`created_by` is dropped (implicit). `foreign_lists` holds every other list.
Each block's `tasks` is the list's pending work filtered **per task** (a row
is kept when its own status is `pending` or `in_progress`, not when its root
is) — distinct from `farol tasks`'s root-based Pending section — capped at the
top 20, in tree order. The rows carry the same `taskRowJSON` fields as `farol
tasks --json` (id, parent_id, title, status, progress, depth, list_owner,
has_notes, notes_len, assignee, assigned_at, assignee_live, priority),
where `assignee_live` is computed from one `ListWork` read per request. The
resource inlines notes unconditionally; the CLI keeps that behaviour behind
`--include notes` so a caller that does not need bodies avoids the bytes. An
empty inbox prints nothing in human mode and `mine` empty / `foreign_lists`
empty in JSON — a normal state, not an error.

**`farol work` is the CLI equivalent of the retired `farol:///work` resource**
(cli-first migration, parity gap #1). It is read-only and non-interactive, so it
claims no presence. It emits exactly one JSON value on stdout in `--json` mode —
a bare array (matching the resource and the other list-returning commands),
of the shape:

```json
[
  { "id", "entity_type", "entity_id", "agent_id", "kind", "acquired_at" },
  ...
]
```

`id` is the `AgentActivity` row's ULID; `entity_type` is `task` or `list`;
`entity_id` names the claimed entity; `agent_id` is who holds the claim;
`kind` is `working` | `inspecting`; `acquired_at` is the unix second the claim
was last renewed (within the store's `WorkTTL`, so the set is exactly what the
TUI shows a spinner for). This is **presence, not assignment**: who *owns* a
task is the task row's `assignee` field, a separate axis (docs/DESIGN.md §3),
and is deliberately not part of this read. The JSON shape is an exact mirror of
the retired resource's array, so a host that read `farol:///work` reads the same
rows here. In human mode `farol work` prints a plain table (no ANSI escapes, per
§9) with the holding agent, the claimed entity, its title resolved
best-effort, the kind, and the claim's age (`2h14m ago`), so a human sees which
task an agent is on without re-reading each entity by id — the resource carried
only ids, so the table is the ergonomic a static JSON blob could not offer. An
empty claim set prints nothing in human mode and `[]` in JSON — a normal state,
not an error.

**`farol claim` / `farol release` are the explicit presence controls** (cli-first
migration, Phase 2). They are the manual forms of the auto-claim every write
already performs (§3): `claim <task-id|list-id> [--kind working|inspecting]`
calls `store.ClaimWork` under `FAROL_AGENT`; `release <task-id|list-id>` calls
`store.ReleaseWork` (a no-op when the agent does not hold the claim, or the
claim already expired). `release --all` clears every claim this agent holds via
`store.ReleaseAgentClaims`, the per-process session-end cleanup the retired MCP
server performed. Presence is orthogonal to assignment (§3): a claim lights the
TUI spinner but does not move a task to `in_progress` and is not ownership. A
claim held by another agent returns `ErrActivityConflict` — a domain error,
never a stolen claim (the refuse-with-no-steal rule). Both resolve the id prefix
against the task table first, then the list table. Human mode prints a one-line
confirmation; `--json` emits one value (`{"ok":true,"id",...}` for claim,
`{"ok":true,"cleared":N}` for release, where `cleared:0` is a normal state).

**`farol work clean` is the on-demand presence-hygiene write.** It deletes
stale `AgentActivity` rows that the opportunistic prune inside
`ClaimWork`/`ReleaseWork` would otherwise leave until the next write: claims
older than the `WorkTTL` (120s) by default, or — with `--agent <tag>` — every
claim held by one tag regardless of age (the session-end semantics of
`ReleaseAgentClaims`). `--older-than <duration>` overrides the age filter.
It deliberately never combines "no agent, no age" into a full-table wipe: a
bare call falls back to the `WorkTTL` sweep, and an agent-only call reuses
session-end semantics. Presence rows are ephemeral by design (§3), so there
is no `--force` and no confirmation. Human mode prints `cleaned N claim(s)`
(nothing when `N` is 0); `--json` emits one value,
`{"ok":true,"removed":N}`, mirroring `release`'s `{"ok":true,"cleared":N}`.

**`farol skill` emits the agent reference** (cli-first migration, Phase 2): the
CLI replacement for the retired `farol_inbox` / `farol_breakdown` MCP prompts.
It prints markdown prose to stdout — the `FAROL_AGENT` identity contract, the
start-of-session reads, the write surface, the presence-vs-assignment
distinction, the list-ownership gate, and the `--json` contract — and, under
`--json`, the same prose wrapped as a single `{"skill": "..."}` value (one JSON
value, per §9). It is a doc command, not a store read.

**`farol agent help` emits the agent interaction protocol** — a doc command
like `farol skill`, not a store read: the minimal loop for taking, tracking and
releasing work (set `FAROL_AGENT`, `farol next`, `farol progress`, `farol
unassign`, `farol work`) plus the presence-vs-assignment distinction. It prints
markdown prose to stdout and, under `--json`, the same prose wrapped as a
single `{"help": "..."}` value (one JSON value, per §9). The full protocol
lives in `docs/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`.

**`farol status` is a read-only store health read.** It reports how many lists
and tasks the store holds, the task status breakdown (pending / in_progress /
complete, counted per row), the store file's size in bytes, the highest
migration version applied (from `schema_migrations`, so it is always an
*applied* version), and the resolved config file path. It is the first thing
to run when a store looks wrong; like every read, it claims no presence. An
empty store is a normal state, not an error: zero counts, exit 0. Human mode
prints a labeled key/value readout (`Lists:`, `Tasks:`, `Pending:`, `In
progress:`, `Complete:`, `Store size:` (human-readable bytes), `Last
migration:`, `Config:`), plain text, no ANSI escapes. `--json` emits one
object — `{"lists", "tasks", "pending", "in_progress", "complete",
"store_size_bytes", "last_migration", "config_path"}` — no envelope.

**`farol config` views and edits the user's preferences**
(`~/.config/farol/config.yaml`, §8). It is a config-file command, not a store
read — like `farol skill` it never opens the store. `get <key>` prints one
key's *effective* value (the stored one, or the compiled default when the
field is absent — a missing file is a normal first-run state); `set <key>
<value>` writes one key through `LoadConfig`/`SaveConfig` (the whole struct
round-trips, so setting one key never drops the other); `list` prints every
key in the file's canonical order. The two keys are `theme` (a non-empty
string; unknown names are allowed, the app falls back to `DefaultTheme`) and
`poll_interval_ms` (a positive integer). An unknown key is a domain error
naming the supported keys. Human mode: `get` prints the value alone, `set`
prints nothing, `list` prints a `KEY VALUE` table. `--json`: `get` emits
`{"key", "value"}` with the value's native type (string for theme, number for
poll_interval_ms); `set` emits `{"ok": true, "key", "value"}` echoing the row
that landed; `list` emits the same rows as a bare array in canonical order.

**`farol watch <task-id|list-id>` long-polls the store and emits one JSON
event per change** until Ctrl+C/SIGTERM (exit 0), for agents and scripts that
want real-time updates without the TUI. It is a deliberate exception to the
one-value rule: output is a newline-delimited stream of per-event shapes —
`{"event":"task_created","task":{taskRowJSON}}`,
`{"event":"task_updated","task":{taskRowJSON}}`,
`{"event":"task_deleted","task_id","list_id"}`,
`{"event":"list_changed","list":{...}}`, and
`{"event":"list_deleted","list_id"}`. Default `--interval` is 1s (the TUI's
poll cadence). `--since <unix-seconds>` makes the first poll replay every task
with activity strictly after the timestamp (created if `created_at > since`,
else updated), then continues live; without it the first poll records the
baseline and reports only changes that happen after the watch begins. A task
target reports only that task's own changes (including new comments) and its
deletion; a list target reports the whole list. Change detection is the
store's `updated_at` signal at second granularity — two writes to the same
task within one unix second are indistinguishable (shared with the rest of the
app). Deletions are only visible from the first poll onward; a `--since`
replay cannot report tasks deleted before the watch began. Transient poll
errors go to stderr and are retried; startup failures (bad id, store open) use
the normal §9 error shape, exit 1.

**`set_status` is the one status/progress write.** It takes 1–50 ids in
one call and accepts `status?` (`pending` | `in_progress` | `complete`),
`progress?`, `percent?`, an optional `comment`, and `force?`; at least one
of `status`/`progress`/`comment` is required. Per id, applied in this
order: assignment guard (a task held by another agent is refused unless
`force`) → reopen if needed → progress → status → comment. One call
replaces the old `set_progress` + `complete_task` + `reopen_task` and
fixes a documented gotcha: progress on a complete task no longer errors,
because the reopen happens first —
`set_status(ids, status='in_progress', progress='percentage', percent=10)`
just works. `status='complete'` cascades and auto-unassigns; `status='pending'`
reopens without cascading. Returns one
`{id, ok:true}` / `{id, error}` row per id in input order (a bad id does not
stop the rest — `batchApply`).
The rename/notes/re-parent/to-root structural edits stay in `edit_task`
(cross-list or ownership-gated, it stays single-task). Each touched
task is auto-claimed under the writing agent's identity, same as the
single-task writes.

**Priority is an agent-settable field.** `add_task(priority?)` defaults it to
`none`; `edit_task(priority?)` re-ranks an existing task. Both are gated as
structural edits — re-ranking is a steer about what should be picked up next,
so it is refused on a list the caller does not own, exactly like a rename.
An **omitted** `priority` on `edit_task` leaves the stored value alone: the
parameter's *presence* is what means "set it", never its emptiness, because
`store.SetPriority` rejects `""` and a rename must not silently clear a
`high` someone set. The
value is validated before either tool writes anything, so a rejected priority
never leaves a created task or a completed rename behind an error.

**Why the surface merges tools rather than adding them.** `set_status`
absorbed the separate status, progress and batch-update tools; `edit_task`
absorbed rename, set-notes and move; `comment` absorbed add-comment and
delete-comment. Each pair differed only in which field it wrote, and every
extra tool is a permanent cost — it sits in the agent's context on every
single turn, whether or not it is used, and it is one more name the agent has
to choose correctly. The count that actually matters is *calls*: an agent
touching fifty tasks should make one call, not fifty. The surface therefore
trades tool count against call count, and call count wins.

**`assign_task` is the durable grab.** `assign_task(ids, release?, force?)`
takes 1–50 ids and assigns each to the calling session's identity. An
explicit `agent_id` parameter is **rejected**, the same way `comment`'s
`author` is: an agent may only assign work to itself, and assigning work
*to* another agent is a human action taken from the TUI. `release: true`
unassigns, and succeeds silently when the caller did not hold the task.
Assignment reserves the **subtree**: it is refused when any ancestor or any
descendant is held by a different agent, so two agents cannot own a parent
and its child. A conflict without `force` is refused with an error naming
the holder and the age — `task 000037YRRJNE is assigned to "claude" (2h14m
ago, no live session)` — and `force: true` takes it, reassigns, and writes
a takeover comment recording who took what from whom. That is the
refuse-with-override rule of §3: a silent steal is worse than no steal. On
a successful assign the tool returns the **full `show_task` payload** for
each id rather than `{ok: true}` — grabbing a task and reading it are one
call, which is the whole point.

**`next_task` is the anti-race primitive.** `next_task(list_id)` atomically
selects the top eligible task, assigns it to the caller, and returns its
full `show_task` payload — the same shape `assign_task` returns. Eligible
means all of: `status != 'complete'`, `assignee = ''`, no ancestor assigned
to a different agent, and no descendant assigned to a different agent.
Ordering is **`priority` descending** (`high` > `medium` > `low` > `none`),
then depth-first preorder position — the same order `list_tasks` returns —
so preorder breaks ties between tasks of equal priority, independent of how
any client happens to display order (the TUI's `s` sort modes re-order only
what is drawn, §6 — never the store). This is the *only* place on the tool
surface where priority changes behaviour. Nothing eligible is **not an
error**: the tool returns `{ok: false, reason: "no eligible task in this
list"}`, because an empty board is a normal state, not a failure. Splitting
this into "read the list, then assign one" would be inherently racy across
two calls; as one atomic conditional update it cannot be raced at all —
which matters because the store file is shared across processes (TUI, CLI,
and every agent session), where in-process serialisation buys nothing. With
`my_list` it makes session open two calls: what boards exist, then here is
your task and everything about it.

**Change-detection is folded into `list_tasks` via `since`.**
`list_tasks(list_id, since=<unix>)` returns only tasks whose `updated_at`
is strictly greater — newly
created, status/progress edited, renamed, re-noted, re-parented, or newly
commented (`AddComment` bumps `updated_at`, so new comments surface too).
Completions surface because `since` widens the default `status` to `all`
(above); pass `status` explicitly to narrow the feed.
The rows use the exact same shape as `list_tasks` (`has_notes`/`notes_len`,
omitted-empty `progress`), so `include=['notes']` inlines bodies identically.
Deletions are not representable by a row filter — a removed task is simply
absent; an agent that must detect deletions diffs id sets against its last
`list_tasks`. `updated_at` now means "last activity, including comments".
The standalone `list_changes` tool no longer exists — the `since` parameter
is now part of `list_tasks`, by the merge rule above: it returned the same
rows, filtered.

**List ownership, and what the agent front end refuses.** Every `List` carries a
`created_by` tag (§2). The agent front end resolves its own identity once at start
from the `FAROL_AGENT` environment variable; the *human* may set it per session
in the CLI config to get a tag that is stable across runs. **When it is
unset the identity is generated per process** — `agent-` plus six random hex
digits — never a shared constant. A constant default was a real bug rather than
a convenience: identity is what every cross-agent guard compares on, so two
unconfigured clients acted as one agent and overwrote each other's work with no
refusal, no `force` and no takeover comment. Either way one stdio session is one
identity, and no tool lets an agent change it. A generated tag is only coherent
because assignments do not outlive their session (§3), and it necessarily
satisfies the `created_by` pattern below, since the server writes it there
itself. A list is writable by that
session when `created_by` equals the identity, **or** when the list's
`collaborative` flag is set (below). The structural tools — `add_task`, `edit_task`, `delete_task` — resolve
their id first (the §9 prefix rule still applies), then refuse a foreign list
with one error shape: `list <id> is owned by <owner> — you may read it and
update task status/progress only`. `edit_task`'s re-parent checks the list it
would move *into* — the parent's list when a `parent` is given, the task's own
list when `to_root` is set — before any write, so a refused move never
half-happens.
(`store.Reparent` independently rejects a parent on a different list, so on a
move that would otherwise succeed the two are the same list; the owner check
runs first and reports ownership rather than the cross-list error.)

**Status and progress writes are never list-gated.** `set_status` works on
every list, as do all reads, the surviving resources, and the prompts.
What is gated is *assignment*: `assign_task`, and any `set_status`/`edit_task`/
`delete_task` on a task whose `assignee` is another agent, are refused
unless `force=true` — the forced write performs the change, reassigns, and
records a takeover comment — the refuse-with-override rule (§3). An **empty** `created_by`
means owned by nobody, which makes the list foreign to *every* identity: an
untagged list — the shape `farol lists add` and the TUI create — is read +
status/progress only for all agents, and only a human can restructure it.
`add_list` defaults `created_by` to the session identity and accepts an
explicit tag matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}$`; `my_list` reports `created_by`
on every row. Ownership is adopted from the `<tag>: <name>`
naming convention in two places: a rename into a
tag adopts the owner **in the same write** (`store.RenameList` — the human's
`farol lists rename Groceries "pi: Groceries"` handoff path takes effect
immediately), and `farol lists add --owner <tag>` provisions an owned list
from the start. One idempotent backfill pass at `store.Open` catches
anything that predates both. The adoption cannot tell intent: any `^tag:`
prefix is adopted, so a human list named `Note: buy milk` becomes owned by
tag `Note` — an accepted false-positive class. The
inverse is deliberately *not* done: `GetOrCreateAgentList` and
`my_list` match `created_by` only, never the name, so an untagged
`pi: ...` list is never silently adopted.

**`collaborative` is an explicit, list-level, opt-in override of the owner
check above** — not "untagged means collaborative" (that would silently open
every existing human list at once), and not per-task (list-level is the unit
the ownership model already uses everywhere; a per-task flag would multiply
the states an agent has to reason about). It defaults to `false` for every
existing and new list, human-set only — the same shape `comments_disabled`
uses (`src/store/migrations/0005_list_collaborative.sql`,
`store.SetCollaborative`), and, like ownership itself, unenforced on the
CLI/TUI side: a human may always restructure their own list regardless of
this flag. A human sets it from the TUI's list-name modal (`n` new or `R`
rename in the Lists panel — the toggle is on the modal in both modes); the
Lists panel marks a collaborative row so it reads
differently from one an agent cannot restructure (§12). `my_list`'s
`foreign_lists` carries `collaborative` next to `created_by`, so an agent can
tell before it tries rather than discovering it from a refusal.

Enforcement of the list-ownership gate now lives in the CLI, not the store:
the store stays a dumb data layer, but each structural task write
(`farol add`, `rename`, `notes`, `mv`, `priority`, `rm`) resolves the
owning list and refuses the write when `created_by` is neither the current
agent (`FAROL_AGENT`) nor the `collaborative` flag — with the exact refusal
message the retired MCP server used (`list <id> is owned by <owner> — you
may read it and update task status/progress only`). Every structural command
carries a `--force` flag that overrides the refusal, mirroring the server's
refuse-with-override rule. **Status/progress writes, assignment, comment
add/delete, and all reads remain ungated** (the same split the server had):
any agent may update a task's status/progress and assign/unassign, because
those are the cooperative writes every front end relies on. Identity is
self-declared and unauthenticated: this is cooperative trust between agents,
not a security boundary. When comments arrive they join the owner-only bucket
behind the same gate.

**Output shapes, pinned.** The subcommand list above fixes *which* commands
and flags exist; this fixes *what each prints*. The shapes below were
settled in phase 2 and are part of the contract,
so an agent that has read one command's `--help` predicts the shape of the
rest; the tests in `src/cli` (lists_test.go, tasks_test.go, search_test.go)
pin them. Two contested calls, and the alternatives rejected: **`tasks` and
`show` JSON rows are a flat preorder array with `depth` and `parent_id`, not
a nested tree** — a caller walks one shape whether or not it passed `--flat`,
and reassembles the tree from the two fields; a nested tree would mean two
shapes to walk and a `--flat` mode that diverges from the default. **Writes
that have no id of their own print `{"ok": true}` in JSON mode, not
nothing** — §9 requires exactly one JSON value on stdout even when there is
nothing interesting to say, so the smallest change (print nothing) breaks
the one-value rule.

- **Writes, human mode:** `lists add` and `add` print only the new id; the
  remaining writes print nothing on success. **Writes, `--json` mode:** the
  two add commands print `{"id": "…"}`; the remaining writes print
  `{"ok": true}`.
- **Batch writes:** `add` with 2+ titles returns `{"ids": [...]}` (the plural
  of the single-add `{"id": …}`, ids in input order); `complete`/`reopen`/`rm`
  with 2+ ids return an array of `{"id", "ok":true}` / `{"id", "error"}` rows
  in input order, a bad id becoming a `{id, error}` row rather than failing
  the call (matching `show`'s batch shape); a
  single id keeps the legacy `{"ok": true}` / `{"id": …}` shapes. Batch
  mutators accept at most 50 ids, like `show`. `rm`'s `--force` gate runs
  before any resolution or delete, so a refused batch deletes nothing.
- **`lists`, human mode:** a `tabwriter` table with the header
  `ID NAME PENDING COMPLETE`, one row per list; an empty result prints
  nothing. **`lists`, JSON:** `[{"id", "name", "pending", "complete",
  "created_at"}]`.
- **`tasks`, human mode (tree, the default):** the §6 sections, headers
  `Pending (N)` / `Complete (N)` where N is the section's row count — a
  section header appears only when the section has rows, and a list with no
  tasks prints nothing at all. Rows follow §12's fixed layout (indent,
  expand glyph, checkbox, title, and the trailing ` (NN%)` progress suffix
  whenever `store.DerivedProgress` reports a percentage). `--flat` prints
  `<id>\t<status>\t<title>` per line instead — the greppable view, no
  headers. **`tasks`, JSON:** the same preorder array in both modes —
  `[{"id", "parent_id", "title", "status", "progress", "depth",
  "assignee", "priority"}]` —
  `--flat` changes only the human rendering. Depth starts at 0 for a root;
  `parent_id` + `depth` let a caller reassemble the tree; `assignee` is `""`
  when unassigned; `priority` is one of `none`/`low`/`medium`/`high`.
- **`show`, human mode:** labeled lines (`Title:`, `ID:`, `List:`, `Status:`,
  `Progress:`, `Notes:` with each line indented two spaces, then
  `Children (N):` and the §12 tree when there are any). The `Progress:` line
  spells out a subtasks task with no children as `subtasks (simple)` rather
  than a misleading `(0%)` (§3). **`show`, JSON:** the task's fields
  (`id`, `list_id`, `title`, `notes`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`,
  `completed_at` as unix seconds, plus `assignee`, `assigned_at` as unix
  seconds or null, and `priority`), its `progress`, and `children` as the
  same row array `tasks` emits, depth relative to the shown task.
- **`assign` / `unassign` / `priority` JSON:** each echoes the field it
  wrote, so a caller never needs a follow-up `show` to confirm what landed.
  `assign`: `{"ok": true, "assignee": "pi"}` — the tag the task now belongs
  to, which is the caller's own identity whether or not `--force` was needed.
  `unassign <task-id>`: `{"ok": true, "assignee": ""}`, the same shape with
  the field cleared. `unassign --list <list-id>` acts on a list and so has no
  single task to report: `{"ok": true, "released": <n>}`, the number of tasks
  whose assignment was cleared (`store.UnassignList`'s count), which is `0`
  when the list held none — not an error. `priority`:
  `{"ok": true, "priority": "high"}`. Failures use the §9 error shape above
  (`{"error": …}` and exit 1) like every other command, including a takeover
  refused for want of `--force`.
- **`progress` JSON:** `{"kind", "percent", "display_as_simple"}`.
  `kind` is the stored `progress_kind`; `percent` is the displayed value —
  the stored percent for `percentage`, the derived ratio for `subtasks` —
  and is `null` whenever the kind has nothing to display; `display_as_simple`
  reports the §3 zero-children subtasks fallback.
- **`search`, human mode:** a `tabwriter` table with the header
  `ID LIST TITLE`. **Ranking:** `store.SearchTasks` returns LIKE candidates;
  title matches are ranked by `sahilm/fuzzy` score, then candidates that
  matched only on notes follow in store order — a notes hit is a real hit,
  just weaker than a title one. **`search`, JSON:**
  `[{"id", "list_id", "list_name", "title", "status", "progress",
  "assignee", "priority"}]`.
- **`export`, human mode (default):** pretty-printed JSON to stdout, or —
  with `--out <file>` — written to that file with a one-line summary
  (`exported N list(s) to <file>`) on stdout. **`export`, `--json` mode:**
  exactly one JSON value, `{ "version": 1, "lists": [ … ] }` — the same
  `ExportDocument` shape, so a caller captures it with no parser changes.
  The `lists` array is the export's `ExportList` shape (id, name,
  created_by, collaborative, created_at, position, and a `tasks` array); each
  task carries every column (§2), the `comments` array (author, note,
  created_at), and the `attachments` array (path, created_at). A list-id
  argument narrows the export to that one list; without it, the whole store
  is exported.
- **`import`, human mode:** `imported N list(s)` on success, nothing else.
  **`import`, `--json` mode:** `{"ok": true}`. A file whose `version` does not
  match `ExportVersion` is a domain error (exit 1), so a future format is
  rejected rather than mis-parsed. `import` is additive: it recreates each
  listed list with fresh ids through `store.ImportList`; it never deletes or
  overwrites existing data. `--list <id>` restricts the import to a single
  matching list from a whole-store file (a non-matching id is a domain error).
  `comments_disabled` is not preserved by export (it is a UI policy default)
  and is restored as `0`; `AgentActivity` (live presence) is intentionally
  excluded.
- **`work`, human mode:** a `tabwriter` table with the header
  `AGENT ENTITY TITLE KIND AGE` — one row per live claim, the entity
  column `type:id` (e.g. `task:01ARZ…`) and the age rendered as `2h14m ago`
  like the §9 takeover message. **`work`, JSON:** the bare array
  `[{"id", "entity_type", "entity_id", "agent_id", "kind",
  "acquired_at"}]` — the exact mirror of the retired `farol:///work`
  resource's array (see above); no envelope, so an empty claim set is `[]`.
- **Empty results, human mode:** a read command whose result is empty prints
  nothing (exit 0); JSON mode prints `[]`. A caller that needs to
distinguish "no data" from "failed" reads the exit code, never the bytes.
- **Human output is plain text — no ANSI escapes** — so a script can capture
  any read command's stdout without stripping styling.

`farol mv <task-id> [--parent <task-id>]` (re-parent a task) is the one
CLI re-parent, without the ±1-level restriction §4 puts on the TUI's *add*
flow — a CLI re-parent is a deliberate restructure, not the inline-add
gesture that rule exists to keep predictable. The task stays in its current
list (a cross-list parent is rejected) and is appended to the end of the
new parent's children, closing the gap it leaves behind. **An empty
`--parent` — the flag's default, so omitting it entirely — moves the task to
the list root**; that is the documented representation of "no parent". `mv`
rejects a target that would create a cycle (reparenting a task under its own
descendant, which would break the tree walks in `store`), and moving a
non-complete task under a complete parent reopens the parent (lossy, per §3)
and switches it to `subtasks` mode so it derives progress from its children.
A complete subtree may still be moved under a complete parent; the parent
stays complete.

## 10. Package layout

Two halves: the Bubble Tea half (`model`, `components`, `cmds`, `keys`,
`appstyles`, `constants`) and the non-Bubble-Tea half (`store`, `apptypes`,
`config`), with one addition (`cli`) for the agent-facing front end:

```
main.go              # cobra root: no subcommand -> launch TUI; else dispatch

```

**`src/store` is the only package that imports `database/sql` or
`modernc.org/sqlite`.** `src/model` (the TUI) and `src/cli` (the CLI) both
depend on `store` and nothing deeper; neither ever builds a SQL string.
**`src/cli` and `src/model` are siblings over the same `store`, not layered on
each other**, which is the structural expression of "neither front end is
`secondary" from §1. `main.go` is the one file that imports the CLI and TUI
to decide which to run.

## 11. Theming

The `Theme` struct, `newTheme`'s tier-derivation math, the `InkOn` contrast
helper, and the picker's live-preview-on-cursor-move mechanic live in
`src/appstyles` and are documented there and below. Do not redesign the
derivation math — it is already tuned across all 14 registered palettes.
The reasoning behind `Lighten`/`Darken` and why `Modal` needs to clear
`BackgroundElevated` by a minimum margin:

**Color lives on a Theme.** Every color the app draws with is a field on
`appstyles.Theme`, not a hex value scattered through a component.
`appstyles.Active` is the one `Theme` in effect; every call site reads it
fresh — `appstyles.Active.TextPrimary`, say — rather than caching a color at
package init, which is what lets a later switch actually repaint: assign a
different registered `Theme` to `Active` and the next frame draws it. Styles
composed of more than one field are functions (e.g. `appstyles.NormalTitle`)
for the same reason, not package-level `var`s: a `var` built at init freezes
whichever theme was active when the package loaded.

`appstyles.Themes` is the registry, built by `appstyles.newTheme` from a
handful of base colors — `Accent`, the text/panel/modal bases, the four
status colors — with everything else derived by `Lighten`/`Darken`. A dark
theme raises a tier's attention by lightening it, a light theme by darkening
it. Adding a theme is choosing those base colors, not hand-tuning thirty
derived ones.

**The asymmetry that drives every imported palette:** tier derivation is
`lipgloss.Lighten` for dark themes and `lipgloss.Darken` for light ones.
`Lighten` is additive — it adds `255 × percent` to each channel — while
`Darken` is multiplicative — it scales each channel by `1 − percent`. For a
dark theme the raise is a fixed climb independent of the base; for a light
theme the step shrinks as the base approaches white. The consequence for
imported colour schemes: **set `Panel` to that scheme's deepest background
tier**, so the raised tiers (`BackgroundContent` +4%, `BackgroundPanel` +8%,
`BackgroundElevated` +12%) land back inside the scheme's own background
range. `ModalBg` is not a raise of the panel ladder at all — it must clear
`BackgroundElevated` by ≥14 per channel (guarded by
`TestElevationSeparation` in `src/appstyles/Contrast_test.go`) or the modal
disappears into the focused panel.

`InkOnLight`/`InkOnDark` are the one deliberate exception to "derived from
base colors": they do not vary with a theme's `Dark` flag, because a status
pill's own fill does not vary with the app's theme either — the text that
reads legibly on a given fill has to stay legible whichever theme is active,
not follow `TextPrimary`, which flips. The `appstyles.InkOn(fill)` helper
picks whichever of the two fixed inks has better contrast on the fill at
hand, and `Contrast_test.go` verifies the result clears its threshold on
every status pill, the accent chip, and the error banner for every
registered theme.

**Elevation ladder (the `raise` coefficients in `newTheme`).** The focused/
unfocused panel step is the focus signal (see §12 "Focus is shown by lifting a
tier"), but the step's *contrast ratio* is inherently small for every theme:
`BackgroundContent = raise(Panel, 0.04)`, `BackgroundPanel = raise(Panel,
0.08)`, `BackgroundElevated = raise(Panel, 0.12)`, `BackgroundRecessed =
Panel` (un-raised base). Both elevated and panel derive from the same base by
`Lighten` (dark) / `Darken` (light), so for a near-black base (dark themes)
the additive step near black is tiny, and for a near-white base (farol-day,
the lone light theme) a larger coefficient *darkens* elevated toward the
*lighter* panel, shrinking the ratio. Measured: the elevated-vs-panel step is
~1.10-1.17 for every theme and is capped at ~1.2 for farol-day under the
additive ladder — a geometric ladder was prototyped and hit the same cap, so
the base palette, not the step function, is the binding variable. The nominal
1.35 target for this step is therefore unreachable without moving the base
colors and/or relaxing the `TextPrimary on elevated ≥ 4.5` ceiling, both out
of scope for the focus bug. The genuinely perceptible, theme-independent focus
signal is the **selected-row** contrast (`ModalBg` for the focused panel's
active row vs `BackgroundElevated` for an unfocused panel's remembered row),
which `chrome.ListRowBg` produces and which measures ~9.5:1 on farol-day —
that is the fix that makes focus obvious, not the panel-surface step.

**Text colors that sit on the elevated tier.** Two imported palettes ship a
body `Text` too dim for a brightened elevated tier — `solarized-dark`
(`#93A1A1`) and `everforest-dark` (`#D3C6AA`) — and were the only themes
failing `TextPrimary on elevated ≥ 4.5` once the ladder was widened. Their
`Text` is lightened to `#BCC4CF` and `#E4D9C0` respectively (chosen as the
dimmest grey that clears 4.5 on elevated *and* on panel). This changes those
two themes' body-text luminance slightly; every other theme's `Text` is
untouched.

**What changes:** the four status-color fields are domain colors, renamed to
match this app's domain:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `StatusComplete` | done |
| `StatusPending` | not started |
| `StatusInProgress` | active |
| `StatusOverdue` | *(reserved; not used in this app — the theme colour is held for a future dedicated project-management app, not farol)* |

The registry holds 14 themes: three of this app's own — `farol-dark`,
`farol-dusk`, `farol-day` — plus eleven imported community palettes
(catppuccin-mocha, catppuccin-latte, gruvbox-dark, gruvbox-light,
tokyo-night, nord, dracula, solarized-dark, everforest-dark, rose-pine,
monokai-pro). The imported palettes carry their original accent, text/
panel/modal bases and status hexes unchanged: a person who knows "Tokyo
Night" should see it render the same way here, because it is the same
theme, not a reinterpretation of one — the one deliberate exception is
`rose-pine`'s accent, which uses the palette's own **Rose** rather than
**Iris** (Iris duplicated catppuccin-mocha/dracula's purple; Rose is
otherwise unused in this theme's fields). **The fresh-install default is
`"farol-dusk"`** (2026-08-18; `farol-dark` was the default before) —
`DefaultTheme` names it, and a config with no `theme:` preference activates
it; every other registered theme (including `gruvbox-dark` and `farol-dark`
itself) stays selectable through the `T` picker and as a saved `theme:`
value.

**`farol-dark` and `farol-day` are the brand pair** (2026-08-10): both are
built from the logo family's three colors — the Night Watch icon's navy
(`#0E1B30` deep / `#22385C` mid), the lamp's amber `#F0B263`, and the
wordmark's cream `#F5EDE4`. The dark theme is the icon itself: deep-navy
surfaces, amber accent, cream body text. The light theme is the lockup
reversed — cream surfaces, navy ink, a darkened lamp-amber accent
(`#A06A0E`, the darkest amber that still reads as the lamp against cream).
Both keep the shared status/danger hexes (darkened for the light theme,
per the washout rule above), and pending carries a navy tint in both,
mirroring how `farol-dusk`'s pending carries a violet one. They replaced the
palettes previously copied from stack-stitcher's `stitcher-dark` /
`stitcher-day`.

**`farol-dusk` is the brand's second dark variant** (2026-08-18), mirroring
Cais's `cais-dusk`: a deeper, richer amber (`#E0954A`) than `farol-dark`'s on
a twilight-violet panel (`#241B33`) — deliberately not navy, so the two dark
themes read as distinct moods rather than one theme with a filter on it. It
replaced `farol-ember` and `farol-slate`, both of which sat inside the same
narrow amber band as `farol-dark` (an accent audit found five out of
fourteen registered themes reading as amber/orange, with zero red, pink, or
yellow anywhere in the registry — see the theme-variety pass, 2026-08-18).
`farol-dusk` became `DefaultTheme` the same day, so a fresh install now
opens in it rather than `farol-dark`.

## 12. Visual coherence: the UI contract

This section exists because "pick something reasonable and be consistent"
is not a instruction that survives being executed by several different,
disconnected contributors across nine phases. Every visual detail below is
**decided, not suggested** — a fixed number, a fixed glyph, a fixed rule —
specifically so phase 4's task tree and phase 6's lists panel, built weeks
apart with no memory of each other, render as one app rather than two
apps sharing a color scheme.

**If a UI element needs a visual detail this section doesn't specify — a
glyph, a spacing value, a color-tier choice — add it here, in this section,
in the same commit that introduces the element.** Do not decide it locally
inside a component and move on; a decision made only in one component's code
is a decision the next component's author cannot find.

**→ For the hardened, actionable verification checklist,** read
[`docs/UI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](UI_INSTRUCTIONS.md). Before marking a component
complete, run the verification script: `scripts/verify-ui-component.sh <component-path>`.

### Background tiers, and sealing them

Sections are separated by background color rather than by borders. The tiers
are `Theme` fields, read through `appstyles.Active`:

| Tier | Field | Where, in this app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | terminal default | outside the app — never drawn on |
| 2 | `BackgroundContent` | the outermost frame, if one exists (gutter between the lists panel and the main panel) |
| 3 | `BackgroundPanel` | the Lists and Tasks surfaces, when unfocused (`raise(Panel, 0.08)`) |
| 4 | `BackgroundElevated` | Lists when it has focus, or Tasks while its task-tree or add-input control has focus (§5), and the highlighted comment card in the Details modal (`raise(Panel, 0.12)`) |
| — | `ModalBg` | every modal (theme picker, confirm, list-name, **and the Details modal**) **and the row the cursor sits on in the task tree** — an active row is its own register, not a tint of the panel it's in |
| — | `BackgroundRecessed` | empty-state cards (§Empty states, below) — equal to `PanelBg`, the un-raised base |

**Every tier must be sealed.** A terminal's SGR reset clears the background
until the next SGR, and lipgloss closes each styled run with a reset — so
any unstyled text later on the same line renders on the terminal's own
own color shows through. Anything that draws text — a tree row, the inline
create input, a list row, a modal's body — needs an explicit background, and
`lipgloss.JoinVertical`/`JoinHorizontal` pad shorter siblings with bare,
unstyled spaces that must themselves carry a background or the terminal's
own color shows through. Wrapping the result in a `Background()` style does
not help, because a style only paints the padding it adds itself. Two rules
follow:

1. **Anything that draws text needs an explicit background**, including
   buttons, cards and list rows. A run with no background set is the notch.
   Components that sit inside a panel take that panel's tier as a parameter
   instead of picking a tint of their own, so they stay flush when focus
   lifts the panel.
2. **Seal innermost-first.** A tree row seals itself,
then the panel it sits in seals what's left, then (if a tier-2 frame exists)
the outermost pass seals last. Sealing only at the outer tier would flatten
the inner ones — the active row's distinct surface would be repainted
to the panel color. `appstyles.FillBackground` is the sealing function.

`appstyles.HasBackgroundBleed` is the matching assertion — tests apply it to
fully rendered frames and component bodies (see
`src/model/layout_test.go`, `src/components/tasktree/scroll_test.go`,
`src/components/detailspanel/Model_test.go` and the per-theme checks in
`src/appstyles/Background_test.go`). This is not
optional polish, it's the mechanical check that catches a missing
`Background()` call before it ships.

### Foreground tiers: never draw in the terminal's default color

Background sealing alone is not enough: a glyph with no foreground SGR in
effect draws in whatever the user's terminal calls "normal text", and nearly
every terminal default is light. On the dark themes that reads fine; on a
light theme it vanishes — `farol-day` made the bug visible, with pending
task titles rendering white on warm off-white. The rule is the foreground
analogue of the sealing rule:

1. **Every glyph draws from an `appstyles.Active` tier.** A row title, an
   expand/collapse marker, an empty-state message, a footer hint — all of it
   carries an explicit `Foreground()`. A styled run ends in a reset, so an
   unstyled glyph appended after a styled one falls back to the default just
   as badly (the row's `▾`/`▸` marker is styled with the row's own title
   tier for exactly this reason).
2. **Widgets from Bubbles are not theme-aware and must be sealed.** A raw
   `textinput.New()` carries no foreground on its focused text and a
   hardcoded ANSI white on its blurred text and default `> ` prompt, and
   `list.New()` ships dark-assumed styles for its filter bar. Every input is
   therefore sealed every render, not once at construction, so a theme
switch cannot leave a stale palette on it: `chrome.SealInput` for the
standalone text inputs (the task tree's `/` filter and inline create,
the Search page's query input, the list-name modal, the Details modal's title and
   compose fields), `chrome.SealListFilter` for a bubbles list's built-in
   filter bar (the lists panel). Each takes the surface the input sits on,
   the way a panel passes its tier down; inputs that clear the default
   prompt (the task tree's filter bar is `/` + query + suffix, nothing
   else) do so at construction.

`appstyles.HasDefaultForeground` is the matching assertion — tests apply it
to fully rendered frames under both the light and the default theme and to
individual rows (`src/model/foreground_test.go`,
`src/components/tasktree/foreground_test.go`, with the SGR state machine
itself pinned in `src/appstyles/Foreground_test.go`). It cannot repaint a
frame the way `FillBackground` can — a missing foreground has to be fixed at
the source — so it exists purely as the mechanical check that catches a
dropped `Foreground()` call before it ships.

### Modal scrim

Every modal composites over the rest of the screen (`AppModel.overlayModal`,
used for the Details panel and every `activeModal`: confirm, help, theme
picker). Before laying the modal on top, `overlayModal` runs
the page underneath through `chrome.Scrim`, which dims the whole page to one
flat `TextDim`-on-`BackgroundContent` tier. Without it, a modal only paints
the columns its own box occupies — any page content in the cells the box
doesn't cover keeps its original styling, and right-aligned row content (a
status pill's tail, an empty-state card's border) ends up reading as
distinct fragments stuck to the modal's edge.

`chrome.Scrim` cannot use a translucent overlay layer: lipgloss's compositor
has no alpha blending, a layer always draws opaquely. It also cannot get
away with wrapping the page in an outer `Background()` style, the way the
outermost frame seal above does — that only paints cells the page left
unstyled, leaving every glyph's own embedded color (a status pill's fill, a
row's `ModalBg`) untouched underneath. Instead `chrome.Scrim` strips every
SGR the page carries (`ansi.Strip`) and re-renders the resulting plain text
in the one muted tier, which recolors every cell uniformly because nothing
embedded survives to compete with it. Every modal gets this through
`overlayModal`; no modal implements its own dimming.

### Focus is shown by lifting a tier, never by changing box size or border weight

A rendered surface's box is exactly the same width and height whether or not
it has focus. What changes is the fill: `BackgroundPanel` (tier 3) unfocused,
`BackgroundElevated` (tier 4) focused. **Do not indicate focus with a
heavier border, a different border color, or a resized box** — any of those
shifts the layout of everything around it by at least one cell, which is
exactly the kind of thing that looks fine in isolation and wrong the moment
two surfaces are on screen having made different choices. One function,
`chrome.PanelBg(isFocused bool) color.Color`, is the only place this
decision is made; each surface calls it rather than branching on focus itself.
The selected task row still uses `ModalBg` as its separate active-register
signal, and the input caret identifies the active control inside Tasks.

The same lift marks the spot the keyboard is acting on *inside* a surface,
not just the surface itself: the notes textarea's cursor line and the Details
modal's percentage value both sit on `BackgroundElevated` while their zone has
focus. A value the user can edit therefore looks lit and reads in
`TextPrimary`, where a value they cannot — a `subtasks`-derived percentage, or
`(no children)` — stays a muted parenthetical annotation. That contrast is the
whole signal that a field takes input; there is no caret glyph, and a component
must not invent one.

**Selectable rows inside a modal** cannot use the tree's lift-to-`ModalBg`
cursor signal, because the modal's surface *is* `ModalBg` — lifting a row
onto the tier it already sits on moves the cursor invisibly (the search
surface shipped that way as a modal: the hint line advertised `↑/↓` while
the highlight was pixel-identical to every other row). The theme picker,
whose rows are flat names, marks its cursor the one way that still contrasts
on `ModalBg`: the cursor row renders `TextPrimary` **bold**, and every other
row renders `TextMuted`, both sealed on `ModalBg`.

**The Search page's result rows play by the page rules, not the modal
rules.** Its surface is a body tier, not `ModalBg`, so its rows are task
rows and use the standard selected-task treatment outright: the cursor row
gets the `▌` accent bar plus the lift (`chrome.BarColumn` and the shared
bar-and-body row split, so bar + body sum to the row width and the lift
reads as a full-width band rather than a highlight behind the text), exactly
as the task tree's selected row does — the modal-era detour through
`BackgroundElevated` existed only because the modal's own `ModalBg` surface
made the standard signal invisible there. Within a row, the characters the
matcher consumed in the title draw in `Accent`: for a fuzzy title match that
is the matched subsequence, which may be non-contiguous; a notes-only hit
highlights nothing in the title, honestly showing that the title did not
match. The highlight comes from one pure function over (query, title)
returning the matched spans, table-tested like any rule-heavy function, so
ranking and rendering can never disagree about what matched. An **active**
list's name is styled exactly like its task title — the two read as one
label — and only an **archived** list's name is drawn in `TextDim`
(suffixed with `*`), the dim tier signaling "this is a different, non-active
kind of list" and explained by a one-line `* archived list` legend shown
only when the current result set actually contains an archived list. The
cursor row keeps `TextPrimary bold` on the title, never on the list name, so
the bold cue, the accent bar, and the match highlight all point at the one
selected row.

### Two shared frames: `chrome.PanelFrame`

`chrome.PanelFrame` owns the body frames: **Lists** and **Tasks**. It renders
those exact labels through `appstyles.NormalTitle()` as an accent chip with a
two-column left gutter, then one blank chrome row before the body. (The Details
surface is no longer one of these — it is a modal, wrapped in
`chrome.ModalSurface`, sized to most of the screen and layered over the body;
see §5.) The frame has **1 row vertical and 2 columns horizontal** padding
(`lipgloss.NewStyle().Padding(1, 2)`).
No component sets its own panel padding value or panel border.

The **Tasks** frame additionally shows the active list's name on its title
row: bold, in the panel's primary text color, right-aligned so it lands on the
body's right edge opposite the "Tasks" chip (`chrome.PanelFrameWithRightTitle`).
The name is truncated (`chrome.Truncate`) to the space the chip leaves, so it
never widens the frame; when there is no active list the row is just the
"Tasks" chip, unchanged. Lists passes no right label.

The frame receives the total surface box. It alone derives its inner body
width and height, so callers never subtract frame padding twice. Tasks
composes its raw task tree above its raw add-input footer inside that one
inner box: the tree clips or scrolls above, while the unframed one-row input
is pinned to the bottom with the same Tasks background and no divider. The
inner renderers receive their supplied dimensions and background; they do not
add a title, frame, elevation, or local padding.

### Truncation: one function, built in phase 3, used everywhere from the start

**`chrome.Truncate(s string, width int) string`** exists by the end of phase
3, not phase 9 — every component that
renders user-supplied text (a task title, a list name, a note preview) calls
it from the moment that component exists, so there is never a window where
different components truncate differently because "polish comes later."
Rule: cut to `width - 1` display cells and append a single `…`, never mid-
escape-sequence, using an `ansi`-aware width measurement (a plain byte-slice
truncate can split a multi-byte rune or an ANSI sequence, corrupting the rest
of the line). **Never truncate a unit to a fragment** — if
a row genuinely has no room for any of a title, show nothing of it (clip the
row) rather than one or two letters followed by `…`.

What phase 9 still owns: *shedding whole optional elements* (a trailing
percentage, a key-hint) under extreme narrowness, which is a different,
coarser mechanism layered on top of truncation, not a replacement for having
truncation from the start.

### The task row's width budget: reserve the fixed things first

`tasktree.computeTaskRowCols` is where a row decides what fits. The order it
works in is the whole point: **the fixed-width cells are reserved first and
the title takes the remainder**, never the reverse. Sizing the title first and
letting the status group have what is left is what produced
`◻ Reach the fe…45%  IN PROGRESS` — an ellipsised title welded to a
percentage, on a row whose right edge landed three columns past every other
row's.

Two rules follow from that ordering:

- **A gutter of one column** (`titleGutter`) is reserved at the end of the
  title cell, so an ellipsised title can never touch the cell after it. It is
  reserved *inside* the title cell rather than added as a column of its own,
  which is what keeps the passengers and the icon column at the fixed offsets
  every row aligns on. The icon column is the row's last cell, right-aligned
  within its own fixed width, so every row's right edge lands in the same
  place whether or not the row carries a glyph.
- **A title floor of 12 columns** (`titleFloor`). When the reserved cells
  would squeeze the title below it, the passengers shed whole — never as
  fragments — in this order: the **trailing icon column and the priority
  badge together first**, then the **assignee badge**, then the
  agent-spinner unit, and the **percentage last**, which sheds only to stop
  the row overflowing. The icon column and priority shed first because both
  are recoverable elsewhere — the notes/comments glyphs are one `enter` away
  in the Details modal, and priority reads from any priority-ordered view —
  so losing them first costs the user the least. At 40 columns the question
  "who is actively working" and "who owns it" still outlive "what should I
  pick up next", and the assignee is still readable in the Details modal and
  over every CLI read (§9). That order is deliberate and is the reverse of
  what the row layout originally specified: the first version budgeted for
  overflow alone, with no notion of a floor, so a narrow row spent columns on
  passengers the row could recover elsewhere while the title shrank to a
  stub. An earlier version of this row also carried a status label in the
  shedding order; the label was removed from the row entirely rather than
  merely shed, because it duplicated information the row already carries in
  the `◻`/`◼` checkbox glyph, its colour, and the Pending/Complete section
  the row sits in (see the glyph vocabulary below).
  Those two plan files are superseded on this point; this section is the rule.

The indent, collapse marker and checkbox are the row's identity and are never
shed, and the title is never dropped below one column. `tasktree`'s width-sweep
tests assert, across a sweep of panel widths, that a row never overflows, that
every unit is shed whole or not at all, that an ellipsised title always has a
blank cell after it, and that every row ends its icon column at the same
column.

### Below the minimum size: one line, not a broken layout

The smallest terminal the app supports is **40 columns by 10 rows**
(`constants.MIN_TERMINAL_WIDTH` / `MIN_TERMINAL_HEIGHT`). 40 columns is where a
task row still seats a checkbox and a title at its `titleFloor`; 10 rows is a
header, a footer, a section header, and enough body left to be worth drawing.

Below **either** dimension the app stops attempting the layout and renders a
single line — **`Terminal too small`** — centred on both axes on the frame's
tier-2 background. Nothing else renders: not the header, not the footer, not an
open modal. The decision lives in exactly one predicate
(`AppModel.terminalTooSmall`), which `View` consults before it composes
anything, so no surface gets to decide this for itself. The predicate answers
`false` until the first `WindowSizeMsg` has arrived, so the pre-layout frame —
width and height still 0 — is not mistaken for a tiny terminal. It is not
sticky: growing the terminal back over the threshold restores the real layout
on the next resize.

### The glyph vocabulary

One table. A component does not invent a symbol not listed here; if a new
one is needed, it's added here first.

| Meaning | Glyph | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task: pending | `◻` | Text-presentation square — the checkbox character Claude Code's todo lists use (`figures.squareSmall`, verified from its source, 2026-08-03). Single display cell, unlike the emoji ⬜ (2 cells). |
| Task: in progress | `◼` | The same filled square (`figures.squareSmallFilled`) complete uses, tinted `StatusInProgress` (amber) instead of `StatusComplete`; title stays `TextPrimary`, unlike complete's `TextMuted` — see Typography below. Reuses the complete glyph rather than a dedicated one: four candidate glyphs (half-filled square both orientations, half circle, hourglass) were tested live in the real app against real terminal fonts and every one rendered wrong — narrow vertical bars, checkmark/flag-looking icons, a bold X reading as "error". Rare Unicode Geometric Shapes codepoints get far less font-hinting attention than the common hollow/filled square pair, so reusing the already-proven-correct filled square sidesteps the problem entirely (2026-08-19). Used for all three progress kinds (§3) alike — the trailing percentage (below), not the checkbox, is what distinguishes them. |
| Task: complete | `◼` | Filled square (`figures.squareSmallFilled`), tinted `StatusComplete`; title renders in `TextMuted`, not `TextPrimary`, once complete — see Typography below. |
| Node has children, expanded | `▾` | One column wide, appended to the *end* of the title (see Row layout below). |
| Node has children, collapsed | `▸` | Same column, same position — the marker never occupies a leading column, so a parent's title starts at its own depth. |
| Node is a leaf | *(no glyph)* | Nothing appended; the title simply has no trailing marker. |
| Task has detail text | `🗎` | U+1F5CE DOCUMENT, left half of the fixed two-cell trailing icon column, immediately right of the priority badge, in `TextMuted`; the column is reserved on every row and the notes cell is rendered blank when `Notes` is empty, so noted and un-noted rows keep the same right edge. The column is two cells because it pairs with the comments glyph (below). Measures one cell in go-runewidth, but it is an emoji codepoint: emoji-capable terminal fonts may render it two cells or tofu — accepted tradeoff, the `✎`/`ⓘ` alternatives were rejected in favour of the literal "document" reading (2026-08-03). |
| Task has comments | `🗨` | U+1F5E8 LEFT SPEECH BUBBLE, right half of the fixed two-cell trailing icon column, in `TextMuted`; the cell is blank when the task has no comments. `💬` (U+1F4AC) was the natural choice but measures two cells in go-runewidth (v0.0.23), which would have widened the column past its partner glyph — `🗨` is the one-cell form (2026-08-06). Absent a comment the cell is blank. `HasComments` is set per-row by `RefreshTasks` from `store.TaskIDsWithComments`. |
| Row card: active bar | `▌` | Left edge marker on lists and task rows. Accent when the row is selected (or the inline input is active), otherwise the row's own status color — see Row layout below. |
| Add-input level: sibling (default) | `-` | §4. |
| Add-input level: child | `+` | §4. |
| Add-input level: parent-of-selection | `^` | §4. |
| Trailing derived/percentage progress | ` (NN%)` | In `TextDim`, rendered at the start of the row's right-aligned block, immediately left of the agent spinner; omitted entirely when `DerivedProgress` reports `displayAsSimple` (§3), never rendered as `(0%)` in that case. |
| Task priority | ` ● HIGH` / ` ● MED` / ` ● LOW` | All caps, with a coloured rank dot, in a content-width cell in the right-aligned block immediately left of the trailing icon column. **`none` renders nothing at all**, since most tasks are `none` and a badge on every row is noise rather than information, so the cell is not reserved and rows do not align on it, unlike the fixed icon column. The badge is drawn in the theme's status tokens rather than its text tiers: `high` on `StatusOverdue` (red), `medium` on `StatusInProgress` (amber), `low` on `StatusPending` (grey). The colour ladder is the signal; the all-caps label reads as a sibling of the row's other state indicators. `tasktree.priorityLabel`/`priorityFg`. |
| Task assignee | ` @tag` | The durable holder of a task (§3), in the right-aligned block immediately right of the agent spinner; the two are adjacent on purpose, because "assigned, but nobody is here" is only legible as a gap between them. The tag is clipped through `chrome.Truncate` to seven cells so one long agent identity cannot push the right block across the row, and an unassigned task renders nothing. `tasktree.assigneeBadge`. |
| Task assignee: stale | ` @tag` in `StatusOverdue` | The **stale-assignment tier**: `assignee != ""` **and** no live presence claim by that agent (§3). Assignment has no TTL and no background sweeper, and a session releases its own work as it exits, so this badge marks the one case left: a session killed before it could clean up. It is the only thing on screen that distinguishes abandoned work from work merely owned, and the human's `u`/`U` release keys (§5) are the only thing that clears it. Rare by design, not routine. `StatusOverdue` is reused rather than a new token added — it is the same "a human needs to look at this" tier the Details modal and the Search page already draw their error lines in. The live-agent set is read **once per refresh** from the activity set the poll already carries, never per row. `tasktree.assigneeFg`. |
| Agent is working | `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧` | 1-cell braille spinner, animated via `AnimTickMsg`; draws `Accent` when the row is focused/selected, `TextDim` otherwise. Rendered in the right-aligned block immediately left of the assignee badge when the row's entity is claimed. The `Spinner(frame int)` function lives in `src/components/chrome/Spinner.go`; no component invents its own glyph. |
| List is collaborative | ` · shared` | Appended to a lists-panel row's count line (`N pending · M done`) when `List.Collaborative` is true — plain text in the same `TextDim` tier the count line already renders in, not a new glyph, so it needs no dedicated symbol here. `src/components/listspanel/View.go`'s `listDelegate.Render`. The rename modal's collaborative toggle (below) reuses the task row's own `◻`/`◼` checkbox glyphs for the same flag, rather than inventing a `[ ]`/`[x]` of its own. |

**Task rows are full-width cards**:
a `▌` bar column, then `{2 spaces × depth}{checkbox}{space}{title}` on the
left and the right-aligned `{progress}{agent spinner}{assignee}{priority}` block, then the fixed two-cell trailing icon column (`{🗎}{🗨}`, each cell blank when its indicator is absent) at
the line's end — the bar and checkbox sit flush, and every level of depth
indents the *whole card* by two columns, so a subtask's bar steps right and no
continuous vertical bar line forms. A parent's title carries the
expand/collapse marker (`▾`/`▸`, one column, no space) at its end — before
the right block when the title is long enough to reach it, dropped
entirely when the title is shed for narrowness — and the whole right block
sheds as a unit before the title does. The trailing icon column is a
**fixed-width column** reserved on every row regardless of whether the row has
notes or comments, right-aligned as the row's last cell, so every row's right
edge lands at the same column. The card spans
the panel body width with `Padding(0, 1, 0, 0)` — no vertical padding,
content-height, so a one-line title makes a one-line card — and the
selected row's `ModalBg` covers the full card, not just the text run.
The checkbox itself carries the row's status: hollow `◻` in `TextMuted` for
pending, filled `◼` in `StatusInProgress` for in progress (title stays
`TextPrimary`), filled `◼` in `StatusComplete` for complete (title mutes to
`TextMuted`) — and the bar is accent
when the row is selected, the row's own status color otherwise. Under
narrowness the icon column and priority shed together first, then the
assignee badge, then the agent-spinner unit, then progress, all whole; the
title and checkbox are never shed. Depth-0 pending example (parent row):
`▌◻ Buy paint for the fence ▾`.

Section headers (`Pending`, `Complete` — §6) render as `{bold TextPrimary}
{section name} {dim count in parens}`, e.g. **Pending** `(3)` — the same
"name, then a muted count" shape the lists panel already uses for a list's
own row, so the two surfaces read as one convention rather than two.

### Section headers: pinned and overflow-marked

When the cursor's section header has scrolled off the top of the task-tree
viewport, it is **pinned** as a fixed line at the top of the window so the
section name and count stay in view while scrolling (renderWindow in
`src/components/tasktree/View.go`). The pin reduces the content area by one
line: `scrollFor` recomputes the offset with `height-1` so the selected row
remains visible in the shrunken window. A header that is already at the top
of the viewport is not duplicated — the pin only takes effect when the header
is above the scroll offset.

The pinned header carries an **overflow suffix** rendered in `TextDim`,
separated from the header by two spaces: the count of task rows hidden above
the viewport (`N above`), the count hidden below (`N below`), or both joined
by ` . ` — e.g. **Pending** `(3)` `  5 below`, or **Pending** `(30)` `  11 above . 5 below`.
When the full section fits within the viewport (no rows hidden on either
side), the suffix is omitted entirely. The counts span only task rows —
not chrome lines like section rules, blank spacers, the filter bar, or the
inline create row.

The lists panel mirrors the same convention: the bubbles list's built-in
pagination dots (which render as `••••…` at the bottom of a multi-page list)
are disabled (`SetShowPagination(false)` in `src/components/listspanel/Model.go`),
and an "N below" line in `TextDim` replaces them via `chrome.PanelBodyWithFooter`
in `View()`, so both surfaces show the same "N below" overflow signal in the
same tier.

### The task tree's filter bar

The `/` filter bar replaces the section headers while the filter is active
(§8). It opens with a bold `TextPrimary` `/`, then the query — the live input
while typing, the same text in `TextMuted` once `enter` has applied it — then
a `TextDim` suffix two spaces along: the **match count**, then two more
spaces, then `esc to clear`. The count is `N matches`, singular `1 match`,
and it counts *directly matched rows only* — the ancestors kept for tree
context are not matches and never inflate it. Both the count and the hint
appear from the first character typed, not on commit: they are what tell a
user a query has gone too narrow before they abandon it. With `/` open but
nothing typed there is no query to count, so the bar shows `esc to clear`
alone.

Inside a directly-matched row, the characters the query matched are drawn in
`Accent` **bold**; the rest of the title keeps the colour the row would have
had anyway. The offsets come from `sahilm/fuzzy`'s `MatchedIndexes` — the
same `Find` call that decided the row matched, so the highlight can never
disagree with the match — and adjacent matched characters coalesce into one
span rather than being styled one rune at a time. A row visible only as an
**ancestor** of a match is not highlighted: it renders elided as
`[…] <title>` in the recessed dim card, which is what distinguishes "this
matched" from "this is here for context".

### Typography: which text tier, when

Three tiers exist (`TextPrimary`, `TextMuted`, `TextDim`); which one a piece
of text uses is a rule, not a per-component judgment call:

- **`TextPrimary`** — the thing being read: a pending or in-progress task's
  title, a list's name, notes body text, a modal's main content.
- **`TextMuted`** — secondary, still-relevant metadata: a completed task's
  title (this is the one deliberate exception to "titles are always
  primary" — completion is exactly the state where a title becomes
  secondary information), section-header counts, a list's pending/complete
  counts in the lists panel.
- **`TextDim`** — inert or placeholder text: an empty-state's message, a
  disabled key hint, the add-input's placeholder text before anything is
  typed, the trailing progress percentage in a task row.
- **The checkbox glyph** — the one place a status token, not a text tier,
  styles a glyph: in progress renders `StatusInProgress`, complete renders
  `StatusComplete` (the same tokens the row's bar column already draws when
  unselected); pending uses `TextMuted`, an ordinary text tier. The three
  text tiers carry no semantic success/warning color, which is why the theme
  holds the status tokens separately.

Do not introduce a fourth informal tier (a hand-picked opacity, a literal
gray hex) for "something in between" — if the three don't cover a case,
that's a signal to reconsider the case, not to add a color.

### Empty states: one recessed-card pattern

An empty *task list* is not one of these: it renders its inline input and the
guidance beside it (§6), which is what gives that condition exactly one
appearance. `EmptyStateCard` is for the states with nothing to type into —
a filter that matched nothing, a lists panel with no lists yet.

Every empty state that does use it is the same shape: a box on the
`BackgroundRecessed` tier, rimmed with
`BorderCard` (not `BorderDefault` — see §11's inherited reasoning: a border
has to contrast with the surface it wraps, and `BorderDefault` moves *toward*
`BackgroundRecessed` rather than away from it), `Padding(1, 2)` matching
`PanelFrame`, `TextDim` guidance text, left-aligned. Do not
center empty-state text and do not give it its own bespoke padding —
reusing the exact `PanelFrame` numbers is what makes it read as "this panel,
currently empty" rather than a different kind of surface that happens to be
nearby.

**The card is sized to its message, then centered in the space it is given.**
It does not stretch to fill that space: a two-line message inside a 28-row
rounded box reads as a large broken panel rather than a note. Only the *box* is
centered — the text inside it stays left-aligned, per the rule above.
`chrome.EmptyStateCard` still returns a block occupying the caller's full
width × height, so the caller composes one thing; the space around the card is
painted in the **caller's own tier**, not the recessed one, because that space
belongs to the panel and not to the card. That is why the function takes the
surrounding background as a parameter rather than assuming a tier.

### First run

The store starts empty, so the TUI creates one list for itself. It is named
**`Inbox`** (`constants.DEFAULT_LIST_NAME`) — a name, not a placeholder. "New
List" described the list's age rather than its contents, read as an unfinished
setup step the user was expected to complete, and the only way to correct it is
`R` in the Lists panel: a panel a first-run user may not have discovered, and
one that is hidden entirely below `AUTO_SHOW_LISTS_MIN_WIDTH`. The name a user
is handed without being asked has to be one worth keeping. It matches what the
agent store already names an agent's own default list (`<tag>: Inbox`,
`store.GetOrCreateAgentList`).

This is only the *auto-created* name, used on first run and whenever every list
has been deleted. A list the user creates with `n` is named by the user in
`listnamemodal` and shares no constant with it. First run does not ask for a
name: `Inbox` is the decision, not a question.

### The chrome-package contract

Before a leaf component (`docs/DESIGN.md` §10) is considered done, it
satisfies all of the following. Treat this as a literal checklist, not
prose to have read once:

1. Every color it draws with is read from `appstyles.Active.*` at render
   time — never a cached package-level color, never a literal hex.
2. Its outer surface is built with `chrome.PanelFrame` (or, for a modal,
   the equivalent shared modal-frame helper phase 3 establishes) — it does
   not set its own padding, border style, or corner treatment. A leaf inside
   the aggregate Tasks surface does not create a second frame; its parent
   frames and seals the aggregate while the leaf uses the supplied dimensions
   and background.
3. Any user-supplied text it renders goes through `chrome.Truncate`.
4. It seals its own background tier before returning its content to
   whatever composes it (§Background tiers, above).
5. Any glyph or symbol it needs is one of the ones listed under §The glyph
   vocabulary — or that table was extended, in the same change, to add it.
6. Focus, if it applies to this component, is shown exactly per §Focus is
   shown by lifting a tier — nothing else changes between focused and
   unfocused.

A component that satisfies 1–6 cannot visually drift from the rest of the
app no matter which phase or which contributor built it — that is the
entire purpose of making the checklist mechanical rather than a matter of
taste.

**For a hardened, actionable version of this checklist with verification
steps, bash commands to check each rule, and examples,** see
[`docs/UI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](UI_INSTRUCTIONS.md). Use
`scripts/verify-ui-component.sh` to check a component against all six rules
before marking it complete.

## 13. Testing

`src/store` talks to a real SQLite file created fresh in a temp directory
per test, so **every** state-machine rule in §3 —
including the auto-completion cascade and the zero-children fallback — is a
plain Go test with no TUI, no terminal, and no mocking required. Write those
tests directly against `store`, not against the CLI or the TUI, wherever the
assertion is about data rather than rendering.

Above that, test in three tiers:

1. **Model tests** — a component takes a message and hands back a model;
   assert on the result directly. `src/model`'s tests build the full
   `AppModel` against a real store in a temp directory (`newTestModel` in
   `src/model/refresh_test.go`) and drive keypresses through `Update`, which
   covers keystroke-to-state flows without a terminal.
2. **Render tests** — a component's rendering is a string
   (`ansi.Strip(m.View().Content)`), worth asserting on for layout and
   styling; `chrome`-level checks like `appstyles.HasBackgroundBleed` belong
   here too.
3. **End-to-end rigs** — a real Bubble Tea program driven over a fake
   terminal are the only way to test a full keystroke-to-render flow. Keep
   them the exception, not the default: they are timing-based and must wait
   for specific output rather than sleep and hope.

The same three tiers are listed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s Testing section; keep
the two in step if you change either.
