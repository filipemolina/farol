# The version the binary reports. `git describe` gives the tag on a tagged
# commit and tag-commits-hash between tags, so a build always says which
# commit it came from. With no tag in history it comes out empty, and the
# binary falls back to the commit in its own build info — see
# constants.Version, which is why this can be missing without breaking.

# Build and install to $(go env GOPATH)/bin (~/go/bin by default).
# ~/go/bin is on PATH, so `farol` is runnable immediately
# after `make build` — no sudo, no extra setup.

# Build and seed the demo, then record a new demo GIF and the README stills.
# Requires VHS (https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) and ffmpeg.
#
# seed.sh runs twice on purpose: demo.tape writes to the store it records
# (it creates a list and two tasks), so the stills would otherwise be shot
# against the demo's leftovers instead of the seeded store they document.
#
# Set FAROL_DEMO_VERSION to stamp a specific version into the recorded
# binary; seed.sh otherwise derives it from git describe, which appends
# -dirty whenever the working tree has uncommitted changes.
