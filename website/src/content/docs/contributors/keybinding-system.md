The keybinding system is built around one rule, stated in `docs/DESIGN.md` §5 and `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

> **Do not invent a keybinding.** Every key lives in `src/keys`, exactly once: components match against those bindings, and the footer and the help overlay render from them, so a key declared anywhere else is a key the help overlay can't advertise and the next contributor can't discover.

## The single source of truth

`src/keys/Keys.go` declares every binding in the app, grouped into keymap structs:

| Struct | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `keys.Global` | Keys that work anywhere no overlay owns the keyboard: `tab`/`shift+tab`, `L`, `1`/`2` (page switch), `q`, `ctrl+c`, `esc`, `?`, `T`, `/`, `F`, `ctrl+y`, `s`, `a` |
| `keys.Tree` | The task tree: navigation, expand/collapse, `space` toggle, `enter` details, `n` new, `d` delete, `[`/`]` outdent/indent, `alt+↑/↓` move, `u`/`U` release assignment, `g`/`G`/`pgup`/`pgdown`, `v` cycle view |
| `keys.Create` | The inline create row: `enter` submit, `esc` cancel |
| `keys.Lists` | The lists panel: navigate, `enter` select, `n` new list, `R` rename, `d` delete, `alt+↑/↓` move, `e` export, `i` import |
| `keys.Details` | The Details modal: `ctrl+s` save, `tab` next field, `←`/`→` cycle mode/priority, `↑`/`↓` percent nudge, `c`/`enter`/`y`/`d` comment actions, `ctrl+y` copy task id |
| `keys.ArchivePage` | The Archived Lists page: navigate, `g`/`G`, `/` filter, `u` unarchive, `d` permanently delete |
| `keys.Overlay` | Every modal: `enter` confirm, `esc` cancel, `y`/`n` yes/no, `↑`/`↓` navigate |
| `keys.ExportModal`, `keys.ListNameModal` | Modal-specific extras (`tab` next field, `space` toggle collaborative) |

Each binding is a `key.Binding` built with `key.NewBinding(key.WithKeys(...), key.WithHelp(...))` — the keystrokes *and* the help text live in the same declaration, so the footer and overlay can never describe a key differently from how it's handled.

## How components match

A component matches a keypress against a binding with `key.Matches`:

```go
case tea.KeyPressMsg:
    if key.Matches(msg, keys.Tree.Toggle) {
        return m, cmds.ToggleTask(m.selectedID)
    }
```

The component never hardcodes a keystroke. The binding is the single declaration; the handler, the footer, and the help overlay all read from it.

## Which keys are live: `Active` and `GlobalsFor`

`keys.Active(ctx)` returns the bindings the user can press right now, in the order they should be shown, given a `keys.Context` describing the screen (focused zone, whether the lists panel is visible, whether Details is open, whether a modal owns the keyboard, whether the create input or filter is active). The rules:

- A modal or overlay owns the keyboard exclusively while open → `Active` returns nothing.
- Details open → only its own bindings plus `esc` are live.
- Archive page open → only its own bindings plus `esc` are live (the same shape as Details, `ctx.ArchivePageVisible`).
- Inline create input active → only create keys plus `[`/`]` are live.
- `/` filter being typed or applied → only `enter`/`esc` are live.
- Otherwise, the focused zone's bindings, plus `tab` only while a side panel is open (with the lists panel hidden the focus cycle is a single zone, so the hint would be dead).

`keys.GlobalsFor(ctx)` returns the always-available keys minus the ones that do nothing in `ctx` — `tab`/`shift+tab` are dropped while the create input is live or when no side panel is open, and `?` is dropped while the create input is live (it types a literal).

## The help overlay

`?` opens the help overlay, and it lists **every key in the app on every screen** — not the keys live on the screen it was opened from. `keys.Catalog(ctx)` builds it from the same binding structs the handlers match against, grouped into scopes (`Global`, `Task Tree`, `Creating a task`, `Filtering`, `Lists`, `Details`, `Archived Lists`, `Overlays`).

Two design decisions make it a reference rather than a corner description:

- **Keys the user cannot press right now are dimmed, not omitted** — a dimmed row reads as "not here", an omitted one as "removed". Availability is carried per-entry (`Entry.Available`).
- **Every scope is present on every screen.** Scopes used to come and go with the context, which made the overlay useless for its actual job: a key you can only read about once you have already found the surface it belongs to is not documented at all. The worst form of that failure shipped once — `n` (new task) was bound, handled, advertised in the footer, and named by the empty state, but appeared nowhere in the overlay.

A scope exists for keys a reader has to plan around before reaching their surface, not for every modal that owns a keyboard. Modals whose controls are visible once open — the list-name modal's input and collaborative checkbox, the export/import modals' fields — advertise their mode-specific keys on their own hint lines; duplicating those rows in the catalog re-teaches what the modal already says. Their generic `enter`/`esc` are the Overlays scope's rows like every overlay's. Modals with invisible key behaviour keep a scope (Details). That is why there is no "Renaming a list" scope.

The guard that keeps this true is mechanical, not review discipline: **`src/components/helpoverlay/coverage_test.go` reflects over every keymap struct the catalog documents and fails if any binding is missing from the rendered overlay.** Adding a field to a keymap struct without documenting it fails the test on its own.

Where a key does something its help text cannot carry, the scope gets a one-line `Note` (`keys.Scope.Note`) — that is how `L` says it also moves focus into the panel it reveals, and how the Overlays scope says the Details discard prompt answers to `y`/`n` alone.

## How to add a new key

1. **Add the binding to `src/keys`** — a field on the right keymap struct, with `key.WithKeys(...)` and `key.WithHelp(...)`. The help text is mandatory: `coverage_test.go` fails on a binding with empty help.
2. **Update `docs/DESIGN.md` §5** in the same commit — the keybinding contract lives there, and a key that works but isn't declared in the spec is a key the next contributor can't discover.
3. **Match against it in the component** with `key.Matches(msg, keys.SomeGroup.NewBinding)`.
4. **Wire it into `keys.Active`/`GlobalsFor`/`Catalog`** if it should be advertised in the footer or the overlay — the overlay's coverage test will tell you if you forgot.

A key that needs a new glyph, a new visual detail, or a new scope note updates `docs/DESIGN.md` §12 and the relevant `Scope` in the same commit — never only the component that happens to handle it.
